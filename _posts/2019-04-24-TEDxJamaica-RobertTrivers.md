* the see and self-deception in Kingston
* Jamaica who would have imagined it this
* very big you see what is the season
* self-deception
* this seat is lying to others and that
* shouldn't be nonverbal it can be verbal
* at the leadership and self-deception is
* lying to yourself you can deny something
* that's true about yourself project it
* onto someone else and then attack it in
* the other person will end with such an
* example now there are two main ways in
* which well the function of
* self-deception is given in the subtitle
* here I believe and I've amassed a lot of
* evidence that support the notion that
* the primary reason we fool ourselves is
* the better the fool of it and there are
* two cases in point if I'm lying to you
* now about something you actually care
* about and you're posting up and better
* yet you know me you can watch my eye
* movement you can listen to the pitch of
* my voice especially if it blows up then
* watch for unusual pauses and so on but
* if I have lied to myself if I'm
* unconscious that I'm practicing
* deceptions my words will be surrounded
* with the sincerity that it's associated
* with honesty
* you'll lack those cues for spotting my
* reception the second is that we're in
* the business of promoting ourselves as
* being more been effective than we really
* are we elta people more than we do were
* more beneficial we're better looking
* we're smarter and so on so in that case
* we can fool people India into having a
* higher image of ourselves than the fact
* worn in often shows up in people putting
* themselves in the upper half of a
* category so eighty percent of high
* school students in the u.s. say they're
* in the top app for leadership ability
* it's not possible
* but for self-deception you cannot beat
* academia in the United States fully 94%
* of professors regard themselves as being
* in the top half of their particular and
* I plead guilty I can be tired down to a
* bed in a backward of UWI hospital and I
* still think I'm doing better than half
* my colleagues and that's not just a
* comment on my college but but this is
* just our mouth this is just the way we
* flap our boat do we really 70 percent of
* us will sing when the top half of good
* looks do we really think so or we just
* flap in our mouths the next experiment I
* think you'll enjoy because it
* demonstrates very clearly that something
* deeper is going on it's not just
* flapping their mouths and this is
* whether we think we're better looking
* than we really are and these are the
* authors eppley and Witcher woman scripts
* over here and what they've done then is
* with the help of a computer named more
* fur with more and more percentage of a
* good-looking face which is the average
* of 15 good-looking women picked out of a
* sample of 60 ok so here is here is the
* witch Church who is 20% better-looking
* here's half and half 50% more they morph
* you with someone who's got craniofacial
* syndrome which makes you ugly now they
* do the same thing with eppley only he's
* not too good-looking to start with
* so you have to kind of shift it but
* anyway he's getting better-looking here
* and even up here in this direction now
* here's the game they play and they say
* it with you so you've got to imagine
* that it's your face and they do it and
* they've morphed it now you're sitting in
* front of a computer screen blingo
* suddenly there are 12 photos in front of
* you max for your age and sex and one of
* them the human and all you've got to do
* is as soon as you spot it hit that
* button and then point to it that
* controls for people making mistakes okay
* but here's the tech in a number of the
* runs and they repeated of course the
* picture of you is real you in a number
* of the runs it's 20% better looking you
* and in the number of runs it's 20% of
* their you so which do you see first well
* you see better looking you first it
* takes five percent longer time for a two
* spot the real you and five percent
* longer still subscribe the ugly you okay
* so in your mind's eye you are twenty
* percent better looking if they give you
* all those fifties at one time that we
* saw there and asked you which one you
* like most
* it's 20 percent better looking and this
* is an important feature of deceit and
* self perception you don't exactly you
* look by thirty percent it's implausible
* you don't exaggerate it looks by 10
* percent we think you're giving away some
* of the benefit so it's about it at
* twenty percent now I don't need a social
* psychologist to tell me about this
* effect because if I'm in a big city I
* see it nearly every week I'll be walking
* down the street like this talking to a
* young and attractive woman not up to
* nothing you understand just a lot more
* like
* like me enough to allow me to stay
* nearby right and while I'm walking along
* I spot on the other side of her an old
* man right here ugly face falling apart
* and he's not even really walking he's
* more like shambling you know and then of
* course I realized that's me
* reflected in the store windows so
* self-perceived means seen really as
* ugliness all right no we use verbiage
* also to alter reality one unto the other
* so for example one simple trick is
* simply whether you make the boys active
* or passive okay so if I was doing well
* then I say I did this I did that and
* benefits rained down on all of you
* but if I do poorly I take the passive
* voice and I'm a victim of circumstance
* and this was perhaps best captured by a
* man who ran into a telephone pole in San
* Francisco about 20 years ago and it's
* reported by the police his description
* was as follows the ball was approaching
* my park when I attempted to swerve out
* of the way and it struck me all right
* perfectly legitimate but it shifted the
* responsibility to the telephone for now
* we know about the importance of words in
* Jamaica I direct Safari for example the
* rest of movement began in the 30s and it
* was a movement of self pride and self
* assertion by the dispossessed by the
* underpass and by those that were most
* African appearance so none of this me
* I'll go shop I am on even we sounded too
* weak because it reminded them of me so
* it's I and I so arrests amount in full
* spirit might say something like this I
* am on a night I've been smoked a table I
* since I see you early all right
* and you feel good when you talk like
* that so my son is on the internet
* looking for Russian sites and he comes
* across the rusted minefields slowly
* going around the bend getting angrier
* and angrier and angry
* what is he mad about the wholesale
* expropriation of Jamaican culture by the
* larger culture with no acknowledgement
* no thanks certainly no penny on the
* dollar
* terms like this next experience hi
* I fooled ya
* iPad ITV John is IP we got okay there
* are other uses that are amusing
* there is something from the euphemism
* treadmill and which we invented
* euphemism for something but then it
* comes to to note the old thing so we
* have to have a new euphemism
* so toilet is too much like what what a
* toilet is so now it becomes a bathroom
* so you're bathing in there but that's a
* little bit too personal so it becomes a
* restroom can you taking a nap in there I
* called the operator at Rutgers
* University to get someone's number and
* some young man answered the phone and
* said information assistance I thought
* I've got the wrong number at first he's
* gotten a verbal range they okay now let
* me give you another example from social
* psychology where we've gotten past near
* words there are two ways you can write e
* on your forehead and what they do is
* they make the person five times and
* write because they don't want to
* thinking about it they wanted time to
* sitting on the side and then just write
* e so you can write a other focus E where
* I write it like this so you can read it
* or you can write a self focused E I
* write it like so and I can see through
* it in that's an e now most people in
* fact write another focus E but what is
* interesting is it depends upon the
* degree of power they feel and there are
* these little tricks where you can induce
* a feeling of power which is a temporary
* but long enough to produce these effects
* or you can't reduce the feeling of low
* power so someone with low power about
* 12% of the time they do an other focus
* social to see all the rest is others
* hoping but if you're high power you're
* three times as likely to be self talking
* there's a series of other car lifts that
* this inducement of a feeling of power
* you recognize facial expressions less
* well you remember faces less well you
* have a harder time taking the viewpoint
* of someone else in a simulated situation
* so power itself is inducing a kind of
* ignorance and blindness of those
* underneath you those underneath I've got
* to pay attention to those variable now
* it's worse if it's a man because we know
* that men in various domains are more
* overtime to them than women are over
* contrast there's a tendency for all this
* to be over countries but it's more Emile
* disease so a powerful man is both equal
* and overconfident that's a bad
* combination and it reminds me of the
* fact that self perception often ends
* badly it gives you some benefits at the
* beginning you fool others you float
* along but it ends badly think rules and
* gooders
* now how soon does this start we know
* that it starts we know that it starts
* very early in life deception by six
* months of age children are already
* crying out of context now this guy's
* about a year old but sorry but he's
* really got exact down on the well so
* let's watch him a bit
* suffering agony now is audience
* disappearance
* now trust me that boy would keep that up
* all afternoon but this is a TEDx talk
* time is limited right now here's a
* little boy I loved was about a year of
* agent and this shows you how the child
* can quickly learn to use a facial
* expression in a novel concept
* you'll hear the father in the background
* saying give me the live son you need
* we'll look
* now notice you saw the fake one first in
* the real one second now we'll just run
* through the real the second time it's
* the same thing but the father
* you look good boy but an actual fact in
* the second key and earlier still the
* child is Michael's brother to last three
* month of pregnancy the child takes over
* control some others lemon sugar level
* raises raises mother's blood pressure
* redistributes the blood around it takes
* it away from feet and hands it does this
* by producing hormones that are either
* identical to or close chemical mimics of
* the hormones the mother uses to control
* those variables at all other times but
* here's a test it produces in hormones at
* a thousand times the concentration that
* the mother does we believe this is
* because of a co-evolutionary struggle
* where initially it started pouring in
* some extra hormones and then the mother
* became inert to them and the offspring
* had to add some and the mother again
* became deaf because it's not to her
* advantage to give the offspring as much
* as the offspring once he has other
* children's just a parcel her resources
* to fashion presence past present future
* I should say so we believe that is
* escalated it so it affect the child said
* mama behold me good the whole day you
* see you Harvey but it's hormones and
* hormone receptors that are carrying the
* argument okay now here's an extremely
* important finding and its general does
* it up justify the children the smarter
* your child is the
* they live I will give you the experiment
* in a second but if your child is a
* little breaks out this is four years old
* it's almost time minutes with a little
* test they lie a hundred percent of the
* time if you have a sole child 65 percent
* of the time now what's the experiment
* it's out sitting here there's a box
* behind the child someone put something
* in the box closes it says I leave the
* room for a couple minutes do not peek do
* that piece well they watch most children
* pee then they come in and they say did
* you beat and both children like about
* 80% of but the key is that they lie more
* the smarter they are all right similar
* effect in monkeys
* okay this is this is size of the
* neocortex this social part of the brain
* but your particular brain size itself if
* you wanted and what you see is the
* bigger the neocortex the more often they
* act receptively in nature this is very
* carefully controlled data I won't bother
* you with those details but the take-home
* message is this intelligent people are
* more likely to lie and they're more
* likely by logic to practice
* self-deception
* we might easily imagine and wish it were
* otherwise but I don't believe it is
* and it means a bright person may have
* seems to give because of his or her
* brightness but is their self-deception
* warping it around in the wrong direction
* and sore okay I always believe in ending
* with a little bit of self-criticism and
* after all if I have a theory of
* self-deception that applies to your
* self-deception and yours but doesn't
* apply to mine there's some deficiency
* here there's some bias here so I like to
* end the sub pieces now in the US I
* almost always end with self-deception a
* war because we us are always at war and
* self-deception mates and I knew
* strong contribution especially to
* disastrous war now what am I going to
* talk about in Jamaica
* there are society level phenomenon of
* corruption and is that the 48 thing but
* I don't know what's about it I want to
* talk about something down at my level so
* here's the paradox of the contradiction
* we have an island that is Shaka brah
* fool
* I tell you talk about fool with
* beautiful women period at the same time
* we have a whole heap of paper
* heterosexual men who go berserk at the
* thought that two men are giving each
* other sexual pleasure what the Rasta
* George is going on here well let's add a
* little bit of science they manage some
* of using experiments in Georgia where
* they took a one heterosexual men what's
* an a1 heterosexual man that's someone
* who has never had a homosexual
* experience nor a homosexual thought or
* fantasy or soul each set now you give
* them a homophobia scale how and here
* upset or rotted do they get full verb
* male homosexuality and you divide them
* into those that are relaxed and do
* litter Piper upset and now is the fun
* party to show dirty movies but your
* first tire participa graph to the base
* of each man's wood and the precision of
* the the petitioner graph allows precise
* measures of changes in diameter okay so
* we started off watching six minutes of a
* man and a woman making love okay
* pornographic film the wood grows
* admirably
* the entire video there's no difference
* between the two groups so I won't tell
* you which is we now you'll watch two
* women making love and the wood starts
* admirably but then it starts sloping off
* and it doesn't quite reach up to a man
* and a woman again these are
* statistically indistinguishable now
* you're probably guessing what's down
* here this is two men getting it on these
* are non homophobic men men that are not
* upset and they show a slight and in
* significant increase in Woodside here
* are the homophobic men would larger and
* pick it up here give me the skin
* somewhere around here you know now we
* know this in the u.s. this is a monthly
* occurrence you know that those who are
* most hostile towards homosexual get
* outed it'd been looked a preacher or a
* politician for their secret homosexual
* life now we don't know if the laws of
* psychology that apply in Georgia also
* apply in Jamaica but it's a first
* approximation we have to assume so
* so that says there they repressed
* suppressed and repressed homosexuality
* problem on this island and it comes out
* in violence now where it comes from you
* have to ask someone else I've spoken to
* people like Brian chanes see I was born
* people that have a lot of insight into
* Jamaican society and they talk about
* father absent families and the behavior
* of the mother when she doesn't have a
* father and lay down the law and so on
* I have nothing to say about it I just
* posed it as a fascist problem of denial
* projection and debt attack so the cecum
* self perception is something that
* applies to all of us at every phase of
* our life from our most intimate
* relations who are natural
* here even to how we talk to ourselves
* it's something we can all participate in
* because the logic is simple and the
* behaviors universal I think
