# Foreword to the Revised Edition 

Jon Kabat-Zinn 

In the annals recordingthe remarkable and improbable confluence of dharma, philosophy, and science inthis era, if such are ever written, The Embodied Mindwill be found to have played a seminal and historic role. 

I was elated and, inmany ways, awed when I first discovered it shortly after it was published bythe MIT Press in 1991. Not that I understood it all, or even most of it, sinceI am neither a cognitive scientist nor a philosopher by training. But Inonetheless was able to recognize its breadth and depth, the rigor, edginess,and bravery of its scholarly lines of argument, well beyond the thought linesof academic cognitive science, and sensed that its publication by the MIT Presswas a landmark and momentous signature of something new and profound emergingat the interface of science and dharma. 

What I did understand ofthe book at the time (which over the years I wound up reading, consulting, andhighlighting on multiple occasions), I found very much in alignment with my ownthinking from early on in my scientific career as a molecular biologistpondering questions such as what makes life life andhow consciousness arises from cells. It was also germane to my work, beginningin 1979, offering relatively intensive training in mindfulness meditation andmindful hatha yoga to medical patients with a wide range of diagnoses andchronic conditions and documenting what ensued in their lives and health fromsuch an engagement. In those early days, I found myself at times somewhattongue-in-cheek referring to this approach—that we later came to call MBSR, for“mindfulness-based stress reduction”—as “Buddhist meditation without theBuddhism,” since mindfulness had been explicitly and authoritativelycharacterized as “the heart of Buddhist meditation.”[1](#FN1)MBSR was meant from the start to be a clinical program orthogonal toconventional narratives of health and well-being, a laboratory for a moreexperiential and participatory medicine, a vehicle for self-education, healing,and transformation rather than a new “therapy.” It was conceived as a publichealth intervention and as a “skillful means” for demonstrating the liberativepotential of mindfulness practice in regard to conventional views of self andthe world and their attendant, often imprisoning narratives, which we allexperience to one degree or another. Without that underlying, if mostlyimplicit element, MBSR would not have been either “mindfulness-based” nor avehicle for dharma and, therefore, to my mind, of little value from theperspective of healing, transformation, or liberation.[2](#FN2)

I remember feelingconfirmed and uplifted by the centrality the authors accorded to “mindfulness”and “mindful awareness” in their wholly radical yet compelling, rigorous, andchallenging attempts to bring together the fields of cognitive science,phenomenology, and dharma to examine the larger connections between mind, body,and experience. This feeling was amplified by the fact that the analysis andarguments were coming from not one but three authors, who seemed to be speakingwith one voice from an unusually deep collaboration, and who were obviouslyalso speaking from their own direct, “first-person”[3](#FN3)experience of mindfulness meditation practice, in addition to being seriousscientist-researchers, philosophers, and scholars with grounding in the worldsof cognitive science and phenomenology, as well as in the contemplative andphilosophical traditions within Buddhism. So it felt that they were themselvesembodying in their collaboration what they were putting forth, a new way of, intheir words, “laying down a path in walking.” This impression is onlystrengthened now by the “correctives” the authors haveadded in their introductions to this edition to clarify a deeper understandingof mindfulness grounded in lived experience and, in particular, inrelationality itself and in what they term “enaction.” These correctives arereally evolving refinements indicative of ongoing learning and growing, and arebased on continuing investigation, reflection, inquiry, dialogue amongcolleagues, and actual embodied and enacted cultivation/practice ofmindfulness. They are themselves “vital signs” of health, if you will,indicators of the vitality of the evolutionary arc of thinking and praxis atthe cutting edge where cognitive science and the meditative disciplinesconverge and radically challenge each other’s models and understanding. Stasisat this interface would be tantamount to attachment to and self-identificationwith unexamined assumptions and particular views, habits of mind that arethemselves root causes of so much ignorance and suffering according to thewisdom traditions that articulated so precisely and rigorously many of thelines of inquiry pursued by the authors in the original text. So suchcorrectives are very welcome signs of a natural generativity, learning, andhumility at play here—just what one hopes for in science, in meditativepractice, and in life. 

At the time of the firstedition and for many years afterwards, the MIT Press was headed up by the lateFrank Urbanowski, a practitioner and student of Buddhist meditation himself,and a friend. Frank knew exactly what he was doing by publishing The Embodied Mind. It became the first and among the mostprofound and transformative of a whole family of books on cognitive science andthe mind that he acquired. It was a cardinal example of what Frank termed“focused disciplinary specialization,” a strategy that continues to be asignature feature of the MIT Press’s publishing approach to this day and thatis responsible in many ways for its ongoing success. The reissuing of The Embodied Mind now, in this new edition, after almosttwenty-five years, with new introductions by the surviving authors and with theoriginal text unchanged, is evidence that the book’s analyses, arguments, andimpact have only grown in importance and relevance over the interveningdecades. Indeed, the world has become so much more receptive to mindfulnessthat this book’s republication heralds a new era in our deep collectiveinvestigation, appreciation, and possible understanding of some up-to-nowfairly intractable domains: the nature of thought and emotion, the nature ofwhat we call “mind” and its non-separation from “body,” and the nature of whatwe call “self” and its non-separation from “others” and from the surroundingembracing world out of which life and mind emerge.[4](#FN4)And let’s include as well the nature of sentience and of experience itself,what the authors now refer to as “first-person experience,” so much less biasedand invalidating a term than its forerunner, “subjective experience.” Theirexpounding on Merleau-Ponty’s notion of “the lived body” alone is a major andongoing contribution to this inquiry.[5](#FN5) 

I started graduateschool at MIT in molecular biology in 1964, wanting naively and romantically toinvestigate the fundamental nature of life and how it relates to self and tomind. I worked on bacteria, bacteriophage, and colicins, hoping that theexperience would serve as a good foundation (it did) for ultimatelyinvestigating the human mind from both the outside (the “third-personperspective”) and the inside (the “first-person perspective”). Bacteria, ofcourse, are single-celled organisms, with an inside that is “alive” and a cellmembrane keeping the inside intact, the outside out, and facilitating adynamical exchange of energy and matter that keeps the inside conditions justright for life to perpetuate itself. Bacteriophage (viruses that infectbacteria with their DNA or RNA) and colicins (proteins that kill certainbacterial cells from the outside, and that are encoded by plasmids within theDNA of the source bacterium) are not alive, but they both use the life of thecell to replicate more of themselves, using different strategies. Fundamentalmolecular and dynamical distinctions between inside and outside, life andnon-life, lie at the heart of one of Francisco Varela’s many interests andcontributions, namely the phenomenon of autopoiesisthat, together with Humberto Maturana, he posited as the original emergence ofrudimentary “cognition” in life. Evan Thompson wrote a whole book on thesubject, tellingly entitled Mind in Life.[6](#FN6)But the subject implicitly and explicitly anchors a great deal of The Embodied Mind and its revolutionary orientation towardembodiment and “knowing”—what the authors put forth, following the terminologyof the Buddha, as a middle way. 

One might say that we are moving toward an intimate yet universal,non-reductionist, non-dual understanding of the phenomenal world and our placein it. This book was and is a major stepping-stone along that trajectory. Suchan understanding cannot ignore the unique particulars of diverse cultures,viewpoints, meditative traditions, and their ethical underpinnings andaspirations, to say nothing of the unexplained but reliably documentedmysteries that Eleanor Rosch points to in her introduction. As she says, the book“is about something real” (X): in essence, “anothermode of knowing not based on an observer and observed” (X).What could be more real, more challenging, and more potentially liberating,transformative, and healing than that? She also cogently points out a range ofcritical issues that need precise clarification and understanding when it comesto determining what people are actually practicing or being taught to practice(very different things in all likelihood) within various curricula claiming tobe “mindfulness-based,” as well as in programs based on other consciousnessdisciplines. The complexities abound. This is both extremely healthy and, atthe same time, a conundrum for scientific investigation, demanding new levelsof precision both in the descriptions of what is being taught and in firstperson accounts of what is being attempted and experienced, moment by moment.[7](#FN7)Francisco Varela would have had a field day with the vast opportunitiespresented to us in this unique era of the confluence of cognitive science,phenomenology, and dharma that he contributed hugely to bringing about. But hisvision, his insights, and his voice are enduring and timeless, intimatelypermeating this volume and residing in the hearts and perspectives of hiscoauthors, as well as in his friends and former students and colleagues aroundthe world. 

May this new editiontouch the minds and hearts and imagination of many, far and wide, in manydifferent disciplines, and contribute to the “profound transformation of humanawareness” (X) that was its original aspiration andremains so, appropriately amplified, to this day. That profound transformationand the accompanying learning to inhabit the spaciousness and boundlessness ofawareness itself as the core of our embodied being, and then taking wise actionfor the benefit of others and ourselves from that vantage point when calledfor, is more sorely needed now on this planet than ever before.

# Introduction to the Revised Edition 

Evan Thompson 

Almost thirty years ago,in the summer of 1986 in Paris, Francisco Varela and I began writing what wouldeventually become this book. I was a first-year Ph.D. student in philosophy atthe University of Toronto and Varela had just moved to the Ecole Polytechniqueand the Institut des Neurosciences. We had met about ten years earlier in thesummer of 1977 when he came to a conference at the Lindisfarne Association, aneducational institute and contemplative community founded by my father, WilliamIrwin Thompson. My father and Gregory Bateson, who was Lindisfarne’s scholar inresidence that summer, led the conference, called “Mind and Nature.”[1](#FN1_1) Varela in turn was a Lindisfarne scholar inresidence in 1978. Living together at Lindisfarne in Southampton, New York, andManhattan, he became a member of our family—a combination of uncle and olderbrother to me, as well as my intellectual mentor. That relationship was thecontext in which we worked together on The Embodied Mindin Paris from 1986 to 1989. 

Varela had moved toParis from Chile by way of the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt (where he hadcollaborated with neuroscientist Wolf Singer for a year)[2](#FN2_1)in order to set up his laboratory investigating the neurophysiology of vision.I had graduated from Amherst College, where I majored in Asian Studies andstudied Buddhist philosophy. I planned to write my philosophy dissertation incognitive science and the philosophy of mind. My first published paper—arevision of my undergraduate thesis on Martin Heidegger and the Japanesephilosopher Nishitani Keiji—had just been published in the journal Philosophy East and West.[3](#FN3_1)Varela had read the paper (I still have the typewritten letter he sent me fromthe Max Planck Institute with his comments on an early draft) and he encouragedme to apply to a German philosophy foundation for research support. A grantfrom the foundation—the Stiftung Zur Förderung der Philosophie—supported mystay in Paris in the summer of 1986. That summer Varela also suggested that Iwrite my dissertation on theories of perception, using color vision, andspecifically the investigation of color vision in different animal species, asmy focus. Comparative color vision was the main focus of Varela’s experimentalwork at the time, so I learned color vision science and wrote my dissertationin his lab while we worked together on this book.[4](#FN4_1)

Eleanor Rosch joined usin 1989. I had moved to Berkeley, where I was a visiting postdoctoral scholarin philosophy, and where Rosch was a professor of psychology. Varela and Roschhad also been friends for many years. The three of us finished the book in1989–1990. 

By the end of our firstsummer working together in 1989, Varela and I had a first draft of the corechapters and a working title—Worlds Without Ground,which became the title of part V—suggested by my father. (We changed the titleto The Embodied Mind in 1990.) The title came fromone of our guiding ideas, the philosophical idea of groundlessness.In Buddhist philosophy, groundlessness means that phenomena lack any inherentand independent being; they are said to be “empty” of “own being.” In Westernphilosophy, groundlessness means that knowledge and meaning lack any absolutefoundation. Biology and cognitive science were arriving at the same idea—thathuman cognition is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by aseparate mind or self, but instead the bringing forth or enacting of adependent world of relevance in and through embodied action. Cognition as theenaction of a world means that cognition has no ground or foundation beyond itsown history, which amounts to a kind of “groundlessground.” At the same time, the discovery of groundlessness places us in anexistential quandary because we habitually experience things as if they didhave an absolute ground, either in what we take to be the outside world or inwhat we take to be our self. Is this discrepancy between scientific knowledgeand lived experience inevitable and insurmountable? Or are cognitive scienceand human experience somehow reconcilable? Is it possible for cognitive scienceand human experience to reshape each other in a transformative way beyond ourscientific and habitual, experiential reifications of a separate self and anindependent world? These questions were the ones that motivated and inspired uswhen we set out to write this book. 

Many things have changedin the intervening years, in ways that make this book more immediatelyaccessible than when it was first published. The embodied cognition approach isnow central to cognitive science.[5](#FN5_1) Whereas thedominant model of the brain in early cognitive science was that of astimulus-driven, sequential processing computer, it is now widely recognizedthat brain activity is largely self-organizing, nonlinear, rhythmic, parallel,and distributed.[6](#FN6_1) The idea that there is a deepcontinuity in the principles of self-organization from the simplest livingthings to more complex cognitive beings—an idea central to Varela’s earlierwork with neurobiologist Humberto Maturana[7](#FN7_1)—is now amainstay of theoretical biology and is receiving increasing attention inneuroscience.[8](#FN8) Subjective experience andconsciousness, once taboo subjects for cognitive science, are now importantresearch topics, especially in cognitive neuroscience.[9](#FN9)Phenomenology now plays an active role in the philosophy of mind andexperimental cognitive science.[10](#FN10) Meditation andmindfulness practices are increasingly used in clinical contexts and are agrowing subject of investigation in behavioral psychology and cognitiveneuroscience.[11](#FN11) And Buddhist philosophy isincreasingly recognized as an important interlocutor in contemporaryphilosophy.[12](#FN12) 

Nevertheless, themotivating questions of this book have only become more pointed. Consider thefrequent pronouncements made in the name of neuroscience that the self isnothing but an illusion created by the brain’s workings, that the world we experienceis really a neural simulation, or that consciousness is nothing but a brainprocess. Our personal experience, however, presents things differently. We feelas if there is a real self that is the subject of our consciousness and that isin direct contact with an independent, real world. Although we may dispute thephilosophical assumptions on which such neuroscientific pronouncements rest,such disputation by itself does nothing to change our lived experience. Hencethe quandary: either accept what science seems to be telling us and deny ourexperience—thereby forgetting that lived experience is the source of science,and that science can never ultimately step outside it—or hold fast to ourexperience and deny science—thereby forgetting that experience itselfconstantly seeks to enlarge its own horizons through scientific investigation.Our present culture is still caught up in the constant oscillation betweenthese two tendencies. 

As this book describes,nihilism is the viewpoint that inevitably arises in this predicament. I use theterm nihilism in Nietzsche’s sense, which NishitaniKeiji elaborated in relation to modern science and Buddhism in his monumentalwork Religion and Nothingness (see chapter 11).[13](#FN13)The nihilist sees through the illusion of a real, independent self that wouldgrasp a real, independent world, but he cannot find another way to be or livewithout the illusion. More generally, the nihilist sees that there is noabsolute ground of meaning—for example, that meaning cannot be grounded on atranscendent God or a real, inner self—but he cannot find another way to be orlive without the desire for such a ground. Eventually the nihilist mistakenly(and incoherently) concludes that even meaning is an illusion and thateverything is really meaningless. 

Our overriding aim inwriting this book was to seek a way out of this impasse by charting a path forthe transformation of both everyday human experience and the philosophy andpractice of cognitive science. 

Our approach was to create a “circulation” between cognitive scienceand human experience. Cognitive science tells us that the processes that bringabout our experience of the world, including our sense of self, are dynamical,distributed in time and space, and extend across the complex couplings of thebrain, the rest of the body, and the environment. Although it may seem as ifthere is a single, abiding self that functions as the controller of the mind,cognitive science indicates that what we call “the mind” is a collection ofconstantly changing, emergent processes that arise within a complex systemcomprising the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical and socialenvironment, and in which we find no single, abiding, and controlling self. Howare we to make sense of these discoveries in relation to our personalexperience? 

However we may choose toanswer this question, we cannot begin to address it without relying on somekind of phenomenology, that is, on some kind of descriptive account of ourexperience in the everyday world. But where are we to find this phenomenology?One place to look is the Western philosophical tradition of phenomenology,inaugurated by Edmund Husserl and carried forward by Martin Heidegger andMaurice Merleau-Ponty. Although we relied on this tradition, especially itsinsights into groundlessness, we also argued that it had gotten bogged down inabstract, theoretical reflection and had lost touch with its originalinspiration to examine lived experience in a rigorous way. (I no longer acceptthis view of Western phenomenology, as I discuss below.) For this reason, weturned to Buddhist philosophy and psychology, which, we believed, were based onscrupulously attending to experience through mindfulness meditation (but seebelow). We focused on two, interrelated Buddhist ideas. One idea was that of not-self or no-self—that thesense of an abiding, controlling self is a construct arising from certaindeep-seated cognitive and emotional tendencies to impute permanence andsingleness to what is impermanent and multiple. The other idea was that of dependent origination—that all phenomena arise dependent oncauses and conditions, and therefore all phenomena lack substantial being. Weargued that these ideas could help to make sense of our lived experience in theeveryday world in relation to the findings of cognitive science, while alsocorrecting the tendency within cognitive science to dismiss our experienceoutright as an epiphenomenal illusion. 

In this way, wejuxtaposed three traditions—cognitive science, Western phenomenology, andBuddhism—and we used Buddhist philosophy and psychology to enrich phenomenologyin ways that could also advance cognitive science. To use a term of art fromhermeneutical philosophy, our aim was to “fuse the horizons” of cognitivescience, phenomenology, and Buddhism in a new and larger understanding.[14](#FN14)On the one hand, we aimed to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science toinclude lived, human experience and the possibilities for transformationinherent in human experience—specifically, the possibility of our not beingheld hostage to the reification of an abiding self, but without our fallinginto the nihilistic denial of the everyday self, a nihilism to which cognitivescience remains especially prone. On the other hand, we aimed to enlarge thehorizon of human experience to include the insights into cognition, the body,and the self from cognitive science. Buddhist philosophy and thephenomenological importance of mindfulness meditation, together with the newlyemerging embodied cognition approach in cognitive science, were the newcritical resources we brought to this effort. In summary, our aim was to forgea mutually enlightening and transformative relationship between cognitivescience and human experience via a pragmatic and open-ended phenomenology ofembodiment. 

Three decades later, Isee this vision and effort to create a new kind of relationship betweencognitive science and human experience as the book’s original and lastingcontribution. It makes the book “about something real,” to borrow the openingwords of Eleanor Rosch’s introduction, while also making the book “not fiteasily into any of the usual academic disciplines” (X).It is also responsible, I believe, for the book’s lasting influence in thestudy of embodied cognition—not just in cognitive science, but also in the artsand the humanities, as well as in somatics and the bodywork disciplines. 

At the same time, when Ireread the book now I cannot help but see it as limited by severalshortcomings, ones that have become increasingly apparent to me over the yearsand that we need to leave behind in order to advancethe vision and project of this book. Specifically, I no longer accept three ofthe rhetorical and argumentative strategies on which we relied. 

The first strategy isour portrayal of Western phenomenology, in the tradition of Husserl, Heidegger,and Merleau-Ponty, as a failed or broken down philosophical project (seechapter 2). On the contrary, Western phenomenology remains a vital and importantmovement of continuing relevance to philosophy and cognitive science, as wellas to practical disciplines of human transformation. My book Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology,and the Sciences of Mind argues this point at length and includes anappendix specifically devoted to correcting and explaining the reasons for ourmischaracterization of Husserl in The Embodied Mind.[15](#FN15)Other philosophers, notably Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi, have shown theimportance of phenomenology for cognitive science.[16](#FN16)Many important phenomenological works have appeared in the last two decades,making phenomenology a rich and active area of contemporary thought.[17](#FN17)These works include not just phenomenological philosophy, but alsophenomenology as a way of doing qualitative research in tandem with cognitivescience.[18](#FN18) Varela, in the last years of hislife before he died in 2001, contributed to this revitalization ofphenomenology, specifically in his contributions to the “naturalizingphenomenology” movement, his helping to found the new journal Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, and especially inhis scientific research program of “neurophenomenology,” which uses Westernphenomenology as well as mindfulness practices in the investigation of thelarge-scale brain dynamics related to conscious experience.[19](#FN19)Neurophenomenology provides the framework for my most recent book, Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience,Meditation, and Philosophy, which revisits many of the ideas and topicsof The Embodied Mind.[20](#FN20) 

The second strategy isour depiction of Buddhist philosophy, specifically the Indian BuddhistAbhidharma school and the writings of the Madhyamaka (middle way) philosopherNāgārjuna, as based on meditation or as deriving from meditative experience. Inow see this idea as being simplistic and inaccurate. As Buddhist scholars havediscussed, the formation and evolution of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist philosophy wereshaped by many factors, such as doctrinal constraints, scholasticism, and the pressingneed to respond to non-Buddhist philosophers.[21](#FN21) For thesereasons (among others), we cannot suppose that Indo-Tibetan philosophical ideaswere derived directly from meditation. Indeed, it is equally possible thattheoretical ideas, such as the momentariness of mental processes (see chapters4–6), shaped certain kinds of meditative experience. The extent to whichBuddhist philosophical ideas either shaped or were shaped by meditativeexperience remains an open and interesting question in the field of Buddhiststudies. 

In any case, classicalIndian Buddhist philosophy was certainly not based on the kind of “Buddhistmodernist” style of meditation that we call “mindfulness/awareness.” “Buddhistmodernism” is a contemporary, transnational form of Buddhism that cuts acrossAsian and Western cultural and geographical contexts.[22](#FN22)One of its central elements is a style of mindfulness meditation practice thatderives largely from the modern Theravada Buddhist meditation revival thatoccurred in Burma, Thailand, and Sri Lanka during the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies.[23](#FN23) The mindfulness meditationmethods promoted by this movement influenced modern Asian Buddhist reformersand teachers, especially in the West, as well as Western teachers who studiedin Asia and returned to teach in the West. Virtually all of the contemporarymeditation instruction texts we list in appendix C and on which we relied indescribing mindfulness meditation can be described as Buddhist modernist works.My point in calling attention to this fact is not at all to suggest thatBuddhist modernism is somehow a less “authentic” form of Buddhism; on thecontrary, such appeals to “authenticity” are unsustainable, for Buddhism is andalways has been a constantly evolving tradition. Rather, it is to alert thereader to the fact that our assumption that Buddhist philosophy derives frommeditation is a typically Buddhist modernist claim and one that does not dojustice to the complex historical and interpretative issues that arise in trying to relate mindfulness meditationpractices (especially in their Buddhist modernist form) to the Abhidharma andMadhyamaka philosophies. 

As a philosopher, I alsofeel duty bound to declare that Buddhist philosophy is every bit as abstract,theoretical, and technical as Western philosophy, so the idea that Buddhistphilosophy is somehow closer to direct experience and thereby more immediatelyphenomenological—as we state at certain points in the text—is misguided.Moreover, being able to be abstract, theoretical, and technical is a strengthof Indian and Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, and also of the Indian and Tibetanphilosophical traditions overall, not a weakness.[24](#FN24)

The third strategy isour tendency sometimes to depict “mindful awareness” or “mindfulness” as aspecial kind of inner observation of a mental stream whose phenomenal characteris supposed to be somehow independent of such observation. This tendency isevident when we argue that mindful awareness reveals consciousness to really bediscontinuous and gappy (rather than just appearing to be so in certaincontexts and under certain conditions) (see chapter 4). Hubert Dreyfus, in hisreview of The Embodied Mind, rightly objected to thisconception of phenomenology as inward observation.[25](#FN25)As he pointed out, such an effort of inward observation alters experience, sono valid claim can be made on the basis of such observation about howexperience is apart from such observation. Moreover, reading the results ofsuch inward observation back into world-immersed, embodied experience wouldinevitably distort such experience. Besides wishing to acknowledge Dreyfus’scriticism,[26](#FN26) I mention it here because theBuddhism–cognitive science encounter continues to be influenced by the idea ofBuddhist mindfulness practice as offering a special kind of introspection thatcan serve the purposes of the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. In myview, however, although mindfulness practices can facilitate a unique kind ofacute awareness of what phenomenologists such as Merleau-Ponty call the“phenomenal field” of lived experience,[27](#FN27) this kind ofawareness is not inward observation in any introspectionist sense of“inward”—for example, it is not the inward perception of basic mental elements,whether these be sensations, after the fashion of Western introspectionistpsychology, or momentary and elementary mental events, after the fashion ofAbhidharma. 

TheEmbodied Mind also contains another, betterconception of mindfulness meditation. According to this conception, mindfulnesspractices should be understood as skillful ways of enacting certain kinds ofembodied states and behaviors in the world, not as inner observation of anobserver-independent mental stream. This conception connects to the central,original idea of the book, namely, the view of cognition that we call enaction or the enactive approach(mentioned at the outset of this introduction). 

In formulating theenactive approach, we drew on multiple sources: the theory of living organismsas self-producing or “autopoietic” systems that bring forth their own cognitivedomains; newly emerging work on embodied cognition (how sensorimotorinteractions with the world shape cognition); Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology ofthe lived body; and the Buddhist philosophical idea of dependent origination,and specifically that cognition and the experienced world co-arise in mutualdependence. The basic idea of the enactive approach is that the living body isa self-producing and self-maintaining system that enacts or brings forthrelevance, and that cognitive processes belong to the relational domain of theliving body coupled to its environment.[28](#FN28) Oneimplication of this idea is that cognition requires the exercising ofcapacities for skillful action and that even abstract cognitive processes aregrounded on the body’s sensorimotor systems, including the brain systems that,as we would say today, emulate sensorimotor processes in an “offline” way.Today, this idea of cognition as based on modal sensorimotor processes iscentral to the approach called “grounded cognition,” where “grounded” meansbased on body states, situated action, and modal perception-action systems.[29](#FN29)

From the enactiveperspective, mindfulness practices should be viewed as forms of skillful know-how for enacting certain situated mind–body statesand behaviors, not as a form of inner observation of a private mental realm.Notice that this contrast—between understanding mindfulness meditation as akind of enactive cognition versus as a kind of inner mental observation—is aconceptual and phenomenological one. Notice also that each conception hasimplications for cognitive science. On the one hand, thinking of mindfulnessmeditation as inner observation of a private mental realm feeds the internalisttendency in cognitive neuroscience to model mindfulness as a kind of mentalactivity instantiated in neural networks inside the head and visible throughbrain imaging tools such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI). This approach runs the risk of confusing thebiological conditions for mindfulness with mindfulness itself, which, asclassically described, consists of the integrated exercise of a whole host ofcognitive and bodily skills in situated and ethically directed action.[30](#FN30)On the other hand, thinking of meditation as the enactment of situatedmind–body states and behaviors requires us to distinguish clearly between thecausally enabling conditions for mindfulness, which include neural systems butare not limited to them, and the cognitive processes that constitutemindfulness as a meaningful form of human experience and that cannot be fullyunderstood unless described phenomenologically. This is one way in whichthinking through the enactive approach returns us to the phenomenology of livedexperience as a necessary complement to scientific investigation. 

Since the publication ofthis book, the enactive approach has usually been understood as a particularversion of the embodied cognition paradigm in cognitive science.[31](#FN31)According to this paradigm, the body plays a constitutive role in cognition,that is, cognition depends directly on the body as a functional whole and notjust the brain. The enactive approach adds a number of specific ideas about thebody and cognition; many researchers have extensively developed these ideas inthe past two decades.[32](#FN32) First, what is meant by “body,”for the enactive approach, is not the body as a functional system defined interms of inputs and outputs—as it is for functionalist cognitive science—butrather the body as an adaptively autonomous and sense-making system. Anadaptively autonomous system is one that generates and maintains itself throughconstant structural and functional change (like a living cell), and in so doingbrings forth or enacts relevance. In being a self-individuating system, it isalso a sense-making one, and in being a sense-making system, it is also aself-individuating one. Cognition and world are interdependently originated viathe living body. Second, the nervous system is accordingly understood as anadaptively autonomous dynamical system: it actively generates and maintains itsown coherent and meaningful patterns of activity, according to its operation asa self-organizing network of interacting neurons. The nervous system does notprocess preexistent information in the traditional computationalist sense; itcreates information in concert with the rest of the body and the environment.Third, cognition as sense-making is the exercise of skillful know-how insituated and embodied action. Cognitive structures and processes emerge fromand constitutively depend on recurrent sensorimotor patterns of perception andaction. At the same time, the sensorimotor coupling between the organism and itsenvironment does not determine the ongoing, self-organizing brain activity; itmodulates it while that brain activity in turn informs the sensorimotorcoupling. Fourth, a cognitive being’s world is not a pre-specified, externalrealm, represented internally by its brain, but is rather a relational domainenacted or brought forth by that being in and through its mode of coupling withthe environment. Finally, experience is not an epiphenomenal side issue but iscentral to any understanding of the mind, and accordingly needs to beinvestigated in a careful phenomenological manner. Hence, in the enactiveapproach, cognitive scientific and phenomenological investigations of humanexperience are pursued in a complementary and mutually informing way. 

Less noticed, however,in the literature on embodied cognition, is that the enactive approach alsoimplies a certain conception of science. This conception derives fromreflexively applying the enactive ideas about cognition to science itself. Oncewe perform this reflexive operation we can no longer hold on to the traditionalrealist conception of science as revealing the way things are in themselvesapart from our interactions with them. Yet neither is it the case that scienceis simply a creation or projection of our own minds. Rather, science is ahighly refined distillation of our embodied sense-making.As Husserl originally argued in his last work, The Crisis ofEuropean Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, the implicitdeparture point and always-present background condition for science is ourconcrete, sensuous experience of the life-world.[33](#FN33)In creating classical science, we set aside features of this kind of experiencethat vary individually and cannot be made the object of a stable consensus.Using logic and mathematics, we create an abstract and formal representation ofcertain invariant and structural features of what we experience underrigorously controlled conditions that we impose, and this formal model becomesan object of consensus and the basis for an objective description. Scientificmodels, according to this account, are formalized representations of the worldas disclosed to our embodied cognition. Put another way, scientificrepresentations map structural and dynamical features of how the world isdisclosed to us at various spatiotemporal scales and of how we are able to acton or intervene in processes at these scales. In this way, scientific modelsare distillations of our embodied experience as observers, modelers, andinterveners. In short, scientific knowledge is not the exhibition of the natureof reality as it is in itself; it is an expression of the relation between ourembodied cognition and the world that it purports to know.[34](#FN34)

It is important to keepthis enactive conception of science in mind when we think about the dialoguebetween cognitive science and phenomenology. Not keeping it in mind meansfalling back into an objectivist conception of science, for which embodied experiencebecomes simply another object of empirical investigation. But lived experienceis inevitably distorted when we treat it this way, that is, as being completelycomprehensible through scientific procedures of objectification. Embodiedexperience is precisely not objectifiable in this way, for it is that whichmakes possible any of our cognitive encounters with any object (as we depict infigures 1.2–1.5). Remembering this non-objectifiable dimension of embodiedexperience—that embodied experience is a necessary condition of possibility foranything showing up as an object of scientific investigation—prevents therelationship between phenomenology and science from becoming lopsided in favorof science. Science departs from and in the end must answer to embodiedexperience and does not provide understanding on its own. This is especiallythe case when the subject matter of scientific investigation is the human mind.

In presenting anenactive conception of science in this book, we used ideas from Madhyamaka philosophy(see chapters 10 and 11). In this way, Buddhist philosophy played a direct rolein shaping the enactive approach. This point is especially important toremember when we think about the dialogue between Buddhism and cognitivescience. This dialogue is not equivalent to the scientific investigation ofmindfulness meditation—a research trend that is becoming increasinglywidespread today but was virtually nonexistent when we wrote this book.Although this research is worthwhile, it is neither the same as nor sufficientfor the kind of circulation between science and Buddhism that we tried tofoster in this book. Buddhist philosophy and meditative practice, especially asinformed by the Madhyamaka tradition, aim to undermine the objectifying and reifyingtendencies of the mind. These tendencies, however, can easily be reinforcedwhen one turns meditative experience into a scientific object—for example, byremoving individual practitioners from their social context, placing them in anfMRI scanner, and projecting their meditative practice onto neural activationpatterns. The Madhyamaka-informed, enactive conception of science serves toremind us that such research provides, at best, a heuristic handle on certainlimited aspects of mindfulness meditation practices as they have beenrecontextualized in the cognitive neuroscience laboratory, not an exhibition ofsome underlying and objective “biological reality” of meditation, let alone adetermination of the value of meditative practice as a way of life. Moreover,without Madhyamaka philosophy and the reflexive application of the enactiveapproach to science itself, we will miss the radical transformativepossibilities of the science–Buddhism circulation, and specifically theprospect of a different way of being in the world and doing science beyond ourhabitual cognitive reifications. In other words, we will miss the guidingvision of this book. 

This vision—to undo orat least reduce our self-centered ways of being, especially as they shape and are shaped by science and technology—is decidedlynormative and so makes this book different from many other scientific andphilosophical works on embodied cognition. Many readers may take this vision tobe a specifically Buddhist one. When I reread the book today, I cannot denythat much of its content and tone justifies such a reading. Nevertheless,promoting a “Buddhist cognitive science” or writing a work of Buddhistmodernism has never been my intention. Indeed, the parts of the book that Ilike the least are the ones where we veer into that mode of discourse. Rather,my intention has always been to foster a new kind of wisdom, one rooted in amature cognitive science that is deeply informed by experiential practices ofethical human transformation. Buddhism is an important source for this effort,but my aim is not to advocate for this tradition per se but rather to draw fromits rich philosophy and practice in order to create a contemplative andcross-cultural cognitive science that does justice to our full developmentalcapacities for awakening. My hope is that this vision can inspire a newgeneration of readers who take up this book.

# Introduction to the Revised Edition 

Eleanor Rosch 

This book is aboutsomething real. For that reason it does not fit easily into any of the usualacademic disciplines. It is not science, it is not philosophy, it is notphenomenology, and it is certainly not Buddhism, although it touches on all ofthese. Nevertheless, for twenty-plus years the book has served as a provocateur for academic and nonacademic readers alike.During that time, the issues with which it deals, such as relations between thesciences of mind and human personal experience (yourpersonal experience), have become more prominent and culturally visible, but byno means resolved. 

A bit of history: Iconfess that working on The Embodied Mind with thelate Francisco Varela sometimes felt to me like entering an Indonesianshadow-puppet play. A central part of these plays is a sequence in which theprotagonists cross into “the forest,” a charmed space where it becomes possiblefor beings from different orders of reality—humans, gods, clowns, heroes,demons—to meet and interact, thereby propelling the drama on its way. In asomewhat analogous fashion, the aim of The Embodied Mindwas to create an open space in which normally separated aspects of humanknowledge represented by different modes of discourse and different academicdisciplines could meet, speak, and perhaps cross-fertilize one another. We wereparticularly concerned with the gulf between the human mind as studied byscience and the mind as personally experienced—now often spoken of as thedisconnect between first person and third person knowledge. To approach thisdisconnect we juxtaposed three disciplines usually considered worlds apart: thenew interdisciplinary science of the mind called cognitive science, thephenomenological tradition in philosophy, and some aspects of the Easternreligion of Buddhism. Through the interplay of these three voices we emergedwith the outline of a new kind of cognitive science called enactionthat we argued would provide the ground for a science both embodied andexperientially relevant. 

Now, twenty-five yearslater, much has changed in the cultural and intellectual environment in whichordinary people live and in which research on body and mind is performed,changes that make The Embodied Mind even morerelevant and probably more accessible than when first published: 

1)  This is the era ofbody, particularly of the brain. New techniques such as functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) and an enhanced electroencephalogram (EEG) have madeit possible to observe changes in blood flow and electrical activity in thebrain in real time, thus providing a window into the relation between thoughts,emotions, and brain activity. Increasingly the prevailing assumption inpsychology, cognitive science, and many other fields is that the mind (andhence experience) is just the brain and that the gold standard for studyinganything human is to observe changes in the brain. Note our new vocabulary: notonly is there neuroscience but also neuro-economics, neuro-ethics … evenneuro-theology. But body is not necessarily the sameas embodied; what is that body that is underscrutiny? 

2)  This is also the eraof personal technology. Hence it is not surprising that the brain (and thus themind with its experiences) is increasingly assumed to work like a computer,that is, for all its subtlety to be a machine that should be studiedaccordingly. A personal side of this technological change may be the overridingof much self-awareness. Where once there were spaces in the day between eventsto digest information, reflect on occurrences, notice one’s reactions, and bewith one’s thoughts and emotions, now there is only time to whip out the cellphone. 

These first two trends have to do with the objectification of scienceand the externalization of our lives; they provide the background from whichthe quest of this book and our concept of enaction stand out as contrast. Thenext three, more local in scope but potentially of great generative importance,are efforts toward reclaiming the mind. 

3)  Interest inphenomenology is growing, particularly in Europe and Latin America. In strictusage, phenomenology refers to work stemming from the school of philosophyoriginated by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, butit is now also applied to research that looks into experience through a varietyof other methods. While phenomenology is the province of my coauthor EvanThompson, I wish to make just one point about it here. We began The Embodied Mind with a single phenomenological insightthat can turn objectivist science (and one’s world view) on its head if oneallows it to. Everything perceived, believed, theorized, researched, and knownis done so by an observer. The brain is seen, dissected, experimented on,believed to be the cause of mental events … by the minds of scientists—andlikewise for the other sciences. (This is what those circular diagrams in thefirst chapter are trying to convey.) From that point of view, the brain isinside the mind rather than vice versa. And it is from that point of view thatphenomenology throws down the gauntlet and challenges cognitive science, thusinitiating, though by no means closing, our conversation. 

4) “Mindfulness”training derived from Buddhist practices has been shown to have both physicallyand mentally therapeutic effects, and use of it is spreading exponentially.There is a corresponding outpouring of research on mindfulness not only toconfirm its clinical effectiveness but, as we might expect, to relate it to thebrain and to develop methods to define it, measure it, and to understand itwithin the framework of our already existing mechanistic science. Such work hasbeen anointed with names like contemplative clinical scienceand contemplative neuroscience, and one can only hopethat this will be a case of “If you build it [here “if you name it”] they willcome.” One positive result is that Buddhism and the large family of conceptsbeing called “mindfulness” are no longer treated as visits from anextraterrestrial as they were twenty-five years ago; both are now—howeverpoorly understood—on the cultural and scientific radar. On the other hand, muchthat Buddhism and contemplative practices in other traditions could contributeto science, not to mention human life (some might say the heart of what theyhave to contribute), is being overlooked or downright banished in the name ofscience. 

5) The theory ofenaction has itself developed. It has been refined and more clearly described(Evan Thompson has been the leader in this),[1](#FN1_2)and there have been advances in knowledge of the phenomenological background ofthe theory. Of most interest to cognitive scientists, enaction is gainingtraction as a philosophical paradigm and has staked claims to be a scientificprogram under which research can be performed.[2](#FN2_2)

In the rest of thisessay I will: 1) summarize the clarified version of enaction—twenty years ofemails from confused readers of chapter 8 have shown how needed this is; 2)show how understanding enaction in full requires input from Buddhism, includingits later forms; 3) appraise the new concept of Buddhist modernism being usedin academia to delegitimize serious study of living Buddhism; 4) critique theresearch on mindfulness that is in vogue and suggest alternatives; 5) discussthe enaction–science interface; and 6) open questions about futurecontemplative neuroscience and the future of enaction. 

## EnactionClarified 

### Phase1 Enaction 

Enaction can beunderstood in two stages. The core idea of enaction is that the living body isa self-organizing system. This is in contrast to viewing it as a machine thathappens to be made of meat rather than silicon. Mechanisms act and change theirstate only because of input and programming from sources outside of themselves,whereas the living body continuously reorganizes itself to survive and maintainits own homeostasis. (Notice how this alone is a radical departure from thedominant view of the body in present research.) Survival means that theorganism must preserve the integrity of its boundaries while having constantinterchange with the environment. Even the simplest one-celled organismexchanges materials through the semipermeable membrane of its cell walls andperforms overt actions relevant to its self-maintenance, such as swimmingtoward a detectable food source or away from insupportable temperatures.Actions of the organism are thus purposive and have been said by enactivists tobe the embryonic forms of cognition, of mind, and even of values. 

The environmentof a given living body of whatever degree of complexity can only be what isknowable and known to its sense organs and cognitions, and that environment isin turn constantly changed by the organism’s actions on it—in the terms we usein the book, neither side is pregiven. The lived body, lived mind, and livedenvironment are all thus part of the same process, the process by which oneenacts one’s world (in phenomenology speak, “brings forth a world”). Humans, ofcourse, can enact self, boundaries, survival, environment, exchange, desire,and aversion into symbolic castles of great subtlety, but that does not changethe basic processes. 

This is a phase 1account of enaction. It seems self-contained as it is; what need is there forBuddhism? In fact a description of sentient beings almost identical to theabove portrayal of enaction is provided in the teaching of the five skandhas (heaps) of early Buddhism. We present the skandhasin chapter 4 as an example of the Buddhist deconstruction of the self, but theycan also be seen as a logical and temporal account of how the false sense ofself is constructed. It begins with a living body with its dualistic senses;develops through that living being’s perception of the world through the filterof what is felt to be good, bad, or indifferent for the subject pole of thedualism; develops yet further into habits based on actions to get the good,shun the bad, and ignore the indifferent; and ends with birth into a moment ofconsciousness already situated in a complete inner and outer “world” stemmingfrom whichever of the basic impulses (desire, aversion, or indifference) of thesubject toward its objects predominates.[3](#FN3_2) But there isone major difference between the phase 1 enactive and the Buddhist accounts: inBuddhism, this is the beginning of the story, not the end. 

### Phase2 Enaction 

From the Buddhist pointof view, both phase 1 enaction and the skandhas are portraits of the confusedand ignorant body, mind, and world that is called samsara,that is, the wheel of life through which sentient beings cycle in ignorance andsuffering (see chapters 4 and 6). The good news is that there is analternative. There is another mode of knowing not based on an observer andobserved. This ushers in phase 2 of enaction, what in the book we call groundlessness (chapter 10). 

At this point we havegone beyond phenomenology. Yes, this is a controversial claim given Heidegger’saccount of Being-in-the-World (in-der-Welt-sein)where there is no split between subject, object, consciousness, and world,[4](#FN4_2) followed by Merleau-Ponty’s psychology that extendsthis foundational idea.5 Added tothese are the new interpretations of Husserl based partly on material of hisnot available when our book was originally written.[6](#FN6_2)But there is a difference between such ideas as philosophy or scientific theoryand what results from the actuality of a mind in the nondual awareness that canbe brought about (uncovered is probably a betterterm) by Buddhist meditations, contemplations, transmissions, and otherpractices. 

Here is the difference.In foundational European phenomenology (for convenience I will use Heidegger’sterminology), the central image of a mind that does not make distinctionsbetween subject and object, that is, of a mind in the pre-reflective natural state,is of a person actively engaged in the world, a person with interests, cares,concerns, and goals who is vigorously pursuing those goals using whatever comesbefore him as a tool. It is when there is some breakdown in that state(something doesn’t work) that the person will draw back, assume the abstractattitude, reflect on experience, and give birth to those distinctions. From theBuddhist point of view, this is a romanticization of samsara. What thatactively engaged person is engaged in is vigorously trying to grasp and clingto what he wants, flee from or attack what he does not want, and ignore what hefeels is irrelevant to himself—all while using objects, other people, and theenvironment only as instruments to foster his desires. The opposition betweenself and other is not a matter of abstract reflection but is built into theengagements of a consciousness birthed via the skandhas or, in our terminology,enacted without awareness of its nature. When theunaware person is actively, even skillfully or harmoniously, engaged in hislife, he is generally in a state of absorption, his mind cushioned by a cloudof fragmented perceptions, attentions, intentions, fantasies, thoughts,efforts, feelings, and memories that give him the sense of who he is and whathe is about, but do not make him fully present (in Buddhist terms he is in “theghostly confusion of phenomenal existence”). And when that person attempts tostop and look at his experience, the shadow of an ever present but slipperyseparate observer already present in the cloud comes to the fore, another kindof fragmented duality that makes it difficult to look. There is no first personhere and only a ghostly sense of any second or third person. 

What Buddhist practiceshave to contribute to this conundrum is that there is a different mode ofknowing altogether in which the mind is neither absorbed nor separated butsimply present and available. There is no longer that observer claimed in thefirst chapter here; experience is simple and self-known. This is the mind thatcan actually know firsthand the groundlessness of the enacted edifice in whichhumans live (chapter 10), thereby clearing the way for transformative wisdom toemerge (hinted at in chapter 11). (A note to phenomenologists: if Nishida andNishitani[7](#FN7_2) appear to be counterexamples towhat I have said in general about phenomenology, remember that both arespeaking from a background of Japanese Zen Buddhism.) 

What next? The title ofour book promises insight into the relation between personal experience andcognitive science, perhaps even a rapprochement between them. Enaction wasproposed as the form of cognitive science that could accomplish this. What isthere to say about such claims now twenty-five years later? I will discuss theexperience side first, and then the science. 

## PersonalExperience: Why Buddhism? 

If you are going to lookinto personal experience in a manner sufficiently rigorous to make it relevantto science, you need some method for doing so. We turned to Buddhism because,in our judgment, it provided what both Western psychology and phenomenologylacked, a disciplined and non-manipulative method of allowing the mind to knowitself—a method that we (in retrospect naively) simply called mindfulness. There are currently two main objections tousing Buddhism in this manner that need to be addressed. 

The first is called Buddhist modernism.Buddhism has changed throughout its history, and a recent book, The Making of Buddhist Modernism,[8](#FN8_1)has argued for a link between changes occurring in Buddhism since its contactwith the West and aspects of modern Western culture. Interestingly, althoughthe evaluative import of the historical data detailed in this wide-ranging workis sufficiently ambiguous that it could have led equally to the title The Decline and Fall of Buddhism or to TheMaking of the Buddhist Renaissance, the Buddhist studies community seemsto have landed primarily on the negative side to the point of using the term Buddhist modernism almost as an epithet. From thisviewpoint our assumption that Buddhist teachings are related to Buddhistmeditations and that both can reveal important aspects of the mind is itselfjust another expression of Buddhist modernism.[9](#FN9_1)

I come to these issuesnot from a context of historical scholarship but from the study of Buddhism asa living tradition and from a background in psychology and the cognitive andsocial sciences. That makes for a different lens. There is a sharp contrast,for example, between the ways Buddhist texts are treated by academic scholarsand by contemporary Buddhist practitioners. Some of the Buddhist doctrines,texts, and teachings that the scholar would claim unrelated to meditation experience(because meditation was so rare historically and/or because Buddhist treatisesand classification systems bear the marks of ordinary scholastic discourse) Isee being used in contemporary Buddhist centers as guides to meditation,pointers to experience, and programs for action in life. Furthermore, if youlook again at the textual record you find that the attribution of doctrinalorigins to meditative realization is not new but actually as old as thecanonical story of the Buddha himself, a pattern that is repeated in the originstories of major texts and the hagiographies of important teachers throughoutBuddhist history. If not a reality, it was certainly an ideal, as wasmeditation itself. In contemporary Buddhist sanghas(communities), there is often a core of dedicated practitioners who are workingtoward such ideals in their meditation—also their lives and community—and someconsider themselves pioneers in a Buddhist renewal. It is easy to miss suchcommunities if sidetracked by the penumbra of new age and other culturalbanalities that tend to surround contemporary Buddhist movements—a cautionarynote about judging contemporary activities from too great a distance. 

Of course neithermeditation nor writing is ever done in a vacuum. Previous texts and teachingsprovide the view for what is to be done and the rationale for why; meditationsand life practices provide the experience to instantiate or amend what wasgiven; and out of that will come new teachers and, perhaps, new teachings, allof this at play within the social structures and background of cultural beliefsand practices of the time. Buddhists look on this as natural, not as somehow adisconfirmation of their teachings. In fact it is considered part of theskillful means of a realized teacher to be able, in response to the needs ofpeople of a particular time and place, to generate new meditation techniques(as occurred in the burst of creativity in Theravada countries upon liberationfrom colonial rule), new teachings (such as Shambhala and Socially EngagedBuddhism), and perhaps new social structures for the sangha (as in Shambhalaand Sarvodaya Shramadana). Evan Thompson describes this kind of cycling backand forth in enactive language in his introduction; in Buddhism it is known as path.

The second mainobjection to our use of Buddhism as a window into personal experience is avariant of the general argument that experience cannot be used as a basis forresearch either in science or religious studies (in psychology, for example,this is the view that gave rise to behaviorism). The particular form of thisview leveled at us is the phenomenological objection that by looking atexperience closely or in any other particular way, one is thereby changing theexperience[10](#FN10_1) (an argument that would applyequally, of course, to phenomenological investigation). For Buddhism thiscritique is a confusion of path with results and a misunderstanding of thenature and purpose of path meditation. 

From the nondualperspective there is no you looking inwardly at a separate experience, but fromthe beginner’s dualistic viewpoint there appears to be; thus meditationinstructions make use of the marvelous human capacity to move one’s attentionin order to direct that attention in ways that will revealaspects of experience hitherto unnoticed or unacknowledged. For example, apractitioner may be told to attend to her breath as it goes in and out. Shortlyshe sees that this is difficult; her mind leaps around and she cannot control oreven find the looker. Here you find the seeds of later recognition ofimpermanence (the movement) and egolessness (no separated looker to look). Suchdiscoveries are not about particular contents of experience but of parametersof its nature, and they are the necessary forerunners for even a glimpse of thenonduality of the Madhyamaka as direct experience rather than only asphilosophical theory. 

## Scienceand Buddhism 

Because Buddhistpractices involve working with experience, one would expect the science–Buddhisminterchange to be a poster child for what we have asked for in a dialoguebetween experience and science. Instead it may presently be a cautionary tale. 

### Mindfulness

In the years since wewrote our book, the word mindfulness has achievedrock star status and attracted an exponentially expanding amount of research.Various trends have fed into this. In 1979 Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University ofMassachusetts Medical Center put together a pioneering program consisting oftwo Theravada mindfulness meditations, hatha yoga, and a number of exercisesallied to Western clinical techniques. He called the program Mindfulness BasedStress Reduction (MBSR)[11](#FN11_1) and it provedremarkably successful at helping chronic pain patients who had hitherto beenfinding no relief from standard medical techniques. Since then the use ofmindfulness in therapies, many modeled on MBSR, has burgeoned, withcorresponding research showing its benefits for a large variety of physical andpsychological ills as well as benefits for people without clinical diagnoses.[12](#FN12_1) A further encouragement for research has comethrough support from His Holiness the Dalai Lama who holds conferences in whichhe dialogues with Western scientists and supports research in other waysthrough his Mind and Life Institute. 

There are endemic problemswith research on mindfulness. My coauthor has provided a critique of this workthrough the perspective of enaction; here I want to indicate briefly some ofits weaknesses as ordinary science. It is basic scientific logic that if youwant to study the effect of something (the independent variable) on a resultantmental or physical state (the dependent variable), you have to know what theindependent variable is and have evidence that it is actually present in yoursubjects. You must also be able to define and measure the appropriate outcomevariables(s). However, defining and measuring mindfulness, as either kind ofvariable, is problematic. Even in early Buddhism there were debates over justwhat kinds of attention constituted mindfulness (Pali: sati,Sanskrit: smrti) and about what other virtues were orwere not to be included in it.[13](#FN13_1) The situationtoday is even more intricate since some teachers in all the forms of Buddhismhave begun to use the word mindfulness to refer toeverything from the most beginning practice to their version of presence with afully enlightened mind. Therapists contribute their own mindfulnessdescriptions, as do popular authors in a variety of genres. Researchers usuallysettle on a single verbal definition, perhaps from another researcher, withoutconsidering what it might imply or questioning whether their subjects are infact doing that. 

Here are some of theproblems with the resultant research:[14](#FN14_1) 1) The major mindfulnessmeasurement scales basically measure Western mental health variables withlittle reference to any of its prior meanings. Not only does this elide whatmight be new and interesting about mindfulness, but methodologically theoperational definition of mindfulness becomes the same thing as the desired outcome of being mindful—a circular process. 2) A widelyused de facto definition of mindfulness is that subjects have taken MBSR, butthe genius of that multifaceted program is that people can benefit from it inmany different ways,[15](#FN15_1) and so benefits may well notcorrespond to the researcher’s definition of mindfulness. 3) If a would-bemindfulness instruction is given, and subjects show a brain response, it isassumed that this is the brain signature of mindfulness—but as every meditatorknows, instruction is not equivalent to performance, and as everyneuroscientist is coming to know, anything that one does affects the brain. 4)Mindfulness is often treated as a mechanism, a pill that should work in thesame way regardless of context, but, as we have seen (and as is basic inenaction), context is important in how people interpret and proceed with whatthey are doing—even for pills. 

Perhaps the finalindignity is that when researchers come to explain mindfulness, they inevitablyassimilate it to an already established and well-domesticated theory inclinical or, increasingly, brain science. This assumes that our scientificknowledge is already complete with nothing new to learn. Is it? 

### BeyondMindfulness: Basic Knowledge Questions 

Are the mind and itsexperiences only the brain? Is the mind limited to the body? Mainstreamneuroscience assumes the affirmative to both questions, but the only evidencefor that position is that changes in the brain can affect experience andbehavior, and vice versa. To take such two-way interactions as a brain monismdepends on a scientific materialist metaphysics, not on science itself. It alsodepends on the assumption that we now know everything basic that there is toknow about matter and living bodies. And finally it assumes that there is nofaculty of knowing beyond the dualistic mind of samsara and phase 1 enaction. 

Evidence contrary tothese assumptions has been slowly accumulating for the past century. Best knownby Westerners are the alternative physiologies offered by the yogic (and Asianmedical) views of the body in which the body is regarded as a pattern ofenergy. The energy channels described in these systems do not correspond to thenervous system of Western physiology but can nonetheless be manipulated bytechniques such as acupuncture to produce both experiences and health benefits.In Tibetan Buddhism, inner subtle-body visualizations and guidance are a partof advanced practices, at least one of which, the inner heat practice of tummo, has readily observable physical effects; forexample, practitioners can raise their body temperature enough to sit infreezing temperatures and to dry wet sheets wrapped around them.[16](#FN16_1) Less dramatic, but perhaps more to the point, isthat movements of energy in the subtle body are understood in Hindu, Buddhist,and Daoist yogas to be the origin of mental effects, such as wildness versusstability of mind. In fact both later Buddhism and Daoism offer inner-energypaths that can transform both the actual embodiment of the practitioner and, ifcomprehended, could potentially transform the understanding of embodiment ofthe scientific community as a whole. Interestingly, hatha yoga and/or qi gongexercises form an integral, though in research generally ignored, part of MBSRand thus may play a correspondingly important role in its health benefits. Inshort, what we have here is an organized and detailed alternative map of a body-mind,consonant with enaction, that cries out for serious scientific investigation.[17](#FN17_1) 

Even more scientificallychallenging is evidence that there could be aspects of mind that are separablefrom the brain and perhaps even the body. Tibetan lamas give mind-to-mindtransmission of various kinds of wisdom states. Unlike the design of multitudesof failed extra sensory perception experiments in the West, such transmissionsare not of mental contents but of what are considered deeper aspects of mind.Although the transmissions are not conveyed by ordinary sensory or intellectualmeans, they can be experienced—as is attested by many Western students ofTibetan teachers. Less exotic phenomena such as experimenter bias or placebo effectsmay or may not be in the same category as this. 

Evidence for separation of the deep mind from the brain occurs in evenmore paradigm-challenging circumstances. At death Tibetan high lamas enter intowhat is called the death samadhi. The lama is medicallydead: no brain activity, no organ activity, but his heart center remains warm,and transmissions of enlightened mind states can emanate from him even morestrongly and clearly than in life. This may continue for days, even weeks orlonger. The Vajrayana yogic explanation is that the subtlest energies of thenondual mind have withdrawn from the outer body into the central channel, havethen united in the heart center, and are now radiating to the world.[18](#FN18_1) Typically when the lama’s mind, in its most subtleyogic sense, is judged to have merged with the dharmakaya(the fundamental ground of being), and his body is cremated, rainbows appear. Ihave witnessed all of this twice; it definitely shakes one’s scientificpreconceptions. 

## Scienceand Enaction 

The idea of the mind asembodied—now generally called embodied cognition—hasbecome an active field of research, often hailed by its adherents as the newparadigm for cognitive science. Such research occurs under a loosely knit consortiumof headings that include: embodied cognition, enaction, embedded cognition,extended mind, grounded cognition, situated cognition, nonrepresentationalcognition, emergent cognition, and anti-Cartesian cognition. The differences inname, to some extent, map differences in theoretical orientation and researchmethods. Thus you can see that enaction, in its particulars, has now become onepart of a more general scientific movement. Interestingly, TheEmbodied Mind is commonly cited as one origin of this entire movement. 

All of this makes senseif one thinks in terms of the sociology of science. New theories should notonly be able to generate multiple experimental or observational results thatolder theories could not, but they are even more likely to gain prominence ifthey are in direct opposition to those previous theories. In cognitive scienceand psychology it helps if some of the new results are provocatively, perhapscharmingly, counterintuitive. Embodied cognition meets all of these criteria. Itsets itself in clear opposition to what it sees as the prevailing stance incognitive science and psychology, that is, cognitivism and computationalmethods that abstract mental performance from the full functioning of the bodyin its environment (see chapter 3). It is likewise in adamant disagreement withthe mind seen as a product of the brain alone. From this quite general basis(perhaps “battle cry” in Wittgenstein’s sense), it is relatively easy togenerate a torrent of experiments and studies by showing that a particularmovement of the body or interaction with the physical or social environmentmakes a measurable difference in cognition or vice versa, all of which count asconfirmation of the basic proposition of embodiment. A final spur to interestin embodiment as a new paradigm is its ability to generate surprise. Oneexample: holding a cup of warm versus cold liquid in one hand changes howexperimental subjects evaluate other unrelated stimuli. 

The content of what isbeing studied and of what is or is not considered confirmation varies with theparticular theory and aspects of embodiment under consideration—as might beexpected from the proliferation of names for embodiment. However, the overallrelationship of these differing perspectives to one another is more like anextended family than an adversarial court case; the adults (the theories) maybicker and dispute, but the children (the experiments) can be shared. In fact,older experimental work, particularly in psychology, done under rather differentauspices, may be repurposed as examples of embodiment, cognitive dissonancebeing one obvious example. 

Enaction as such hasfared well in this environment. It has not lost its integrity amid the otherforms of embodied cognition and has maintained its close association withphenomenological thought. Enaction brings a distinctive perspective into theembodiment conversation. Whereas most embodiment research focuses on theinteraction between body and mind, body and environment, or environment and mind,enaction sees the lived body as a single system that encompasses all three.19 Systems analysis thus becomesthe basic framework that guides much enaction research. Although at its mostabstract theoretical level enaction could be considered a philosophy too broadto be subject to empirical testing (is there anything that cannot be interpreted in an enactive framework?), at present acoterie of enthusiastic enactivists are finding ways to translate thatoverarching view into hierarchies of increasingly specific descriptions,hypotheses, and mechanisms that at their most concrete can connect withscience.[20](#FN20_1) 

Work on socialinteraction appears emblematic of enaction research and can illustrate thisprocess. Embodied social interaction is seen as “mutual participatorysense-making.” How is this to be translated into specifics? In the first placeit is mutual and thus system based; thisdifferentiates it strongly from theory-of-mind and other current models thatplace the internal cognition of individuals (who must use verbal and physicalcues to guess one another’s states of mind) as the nexus of social dynamics.Second it is participatory; the participants who areinteracting are doing something, thereby creating a system that is changing.Such systems can be subjected to a dynamical systems analysis using variableswithin that method such as dynamical transitions in coordination patterns.Finally there is sense-making, which is defined asthe ongoing emergence of roles, values, dispositions to act, and meanings.These terms could potentially be given operational definitions and then bemeasured by whatever methods are available considering the species under studyand other particulars of the situation. Because all of this is seen as enabledby lower-level mechanisms in the body and brain, a universe of possibilities isopened for specific hypotheses and research. For example, according to theenactive “interactive brain hypothesis,”[21](#FN21_1) the brain isprimarily an organ of relational cognition. Thus it has evolved so thatorganisms have “quasi-automatic attunement to others.” Evidence for this can begathered from a wide range of sources, from the stereotypical threat displaysand maternal behaviors of many species to the brain patterns of humans thatcharacterize being “ready to act.” While much of the experimental researchpresently cited in enaction papers comes from work previously performed withintheoretical frameworks remote from enaction, increasingly studies are appearingthat are inspired (at least in part) by enaction itself. 

## The Future 

### Neuroscienceand the Mind 

In TheStructure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argues that scienceproceeds by increments within a given accepted paradigm until the usefulness ofthat paradigm for new discoveries wanes, and observations that do not fitaccumulate sufficiently to force a shift to a new paradigm. At this particularjuncture of historical time, discovering brain correlates of experience is newenough to enthrall researchers and the public alike and to appear to explaineverything. But ten years from now? Richard Davidson, a pioneer in brainresearch on emotions and on mindfulness puts it this way: “… it wasn’t thatsurprising that meditation produces distinct patterns of brain activity. Thatgoes without saying—anything the mind and therefore the brain does is marked byspecific patterns of neuronal firing in specific areas, just as your muscleshave particular patterns of electrical activity when you work out.”[22](#FN22_1) Davidson is looking for changes that last overtime and are part of a more general theoretical understanding. We can predictthat increasingly the dialogue between experience and science called for by The Embodied Mind will require more than finding simplebrain correlates of mental activity. 

Meanwhile observationsthat do not fit the mind-is-only-brain (or even mind-is-only-body) paradigm arebuilding. In recent years, two books have thoughtfully addressed this issue.Edward Kelly and Emily Kelly[23](#FN23_1) provide acompendium of well-documented case studies and experiments indicating that themind is something in its own right apart from the brain. Some examples are:extreme psychosomatic effects, out-of-body experiences during clinical deathwhile undergoing surgery, feats of Hindu yogis who remained alive and cognizantfor long periods with heartbeat and respiration suspended, physiologicalchanges induced by hypnosis, and many others. The death samadhi of Tibetanlamas is the most extreme example. Charles Tart[24](#FN24_1)offers a similarly motivated collection. He also ranks categories of suchparadigm-challenging phenomena as to how well documented they are. 

What would put thesepresently marginal studies center stage, of course, would be if physics were todiscover something measurable about the mind, apart from the brain, that fitwithin the ever-expanding domain of what is considered material. We now haveparticles without mass, dark energy, bosons of various types, and, at leasttheoretically, vibrating strings of energy that constitute the universe—howabout massless mentons that operate within a mentalenergy field? Not impossible; we don’t know everything. 

### TheFuture of Enaction 

Enaction occupies aliminal and potentially fertile place in cognitive science. It is a philosophythat is shape shifting into science. As such it may be unique, but it runs somerisks. One of the signatures of enactive language, inherited fromphenomenology, is its ability to evoke a sense of humanity and deep respect forlife. But as it reaches the level of specificity where it is reframed into theimpersonal world of dynamic systems analysis, brain mechanisms, and so on, itcan easily lose the mind/experience aspect of the lived body and drift toward abody-based reductionist materialism much like brain reductionism. Retaininginput from Buddhism or one of the other contemplative traditions could behelpful for anchoring it in its original roots. 

Enaction would also dowell to continue to expand its analysis of the processes that psychology calls “higher-level cognition.” In complex organisms likehumans, how does the principle of self-organization (survival, boundaries,exchange with environments, purposiveness) relate to the multiple and possiblyhierarchical systems that make up the body and mind? How does enaction accountfor and work in relation to symbol systems, language, and all of the vastsymbolic extensions of the human definition of self and its boundaries? Andwhat is it that breaks down in pathologies of self-organization andself-maintenance such as autoimmune disease, cancers, and emotive thoughtpatterns so self-destructive that they may even lead to suicide?[25](#FN25_1) What might enaction have to say about socialsystems and their pathologies or about other challenging societal endeavorssuch as warfare and peace negotiations? 

Is there a place in allthis, either in the philosophy or science of enaction, for its type 2counterpart? At present, this would seem to rest on the intelligence andawareness of individual people. For example, there are forms of therapeuticbodywork based on the principle of self-organization and possiblereorganization,[26](#FN26_1) but beyond the theory, what is sostriking about them is that from numerous case studies and patient narratives,one can see the therapist, operating perhaps from a vantage point past theordinary restricted consciousness of phase 1 enaction, reaching out to connectwith the inner intelligence of the client and probing for what will initiatethe needed reorganization. The same can probably be said for founders andskilled practitioners of other kinds of therapies. For example, the Bill Moyersdocumentary on MBSR[27](#FN27_1) reveals Kabat-Zinn as an inspiredand inspiring teacher who is tangibly conveying more to his patients than anysimple automated technique. Perhaps the extreme of this kind of intelligence isthe presence felt from some religious teachers whose wisdom seems to go wellbeyond their doctrine—a specialty of Tibetan lamas whose ability to functionand palpably transmit beyond concepts is almost part of their job description.And, of course, in our not-yet-very-enlightened society, it is at the level ofthe individual that some people will be able to break out of the constraints ofdynamically escalating destructive interactive systems (such as domesticquarrels, obedience-to-authority psychology experiments, and group aggression).Something of this type of vision may also be needed for scientists; that is,researchers need to be able to look at their subject matter from a position ofunderstanding beyond where their field already is in order to make creativecontributions. 

### EndingNote 

For a real dialogue (ortrialogue) to occur, all sides need to speak and be heard equally. That has nothappened yet for the topics we explore in The Embodied Mind.Where science, as it is done now with its mechanistic and materialistassumptions, meets experience, Buddhism, or anything else, the science simplytakes over like a colonial ruler. This is body imperialism, not dialogue. Itneed not always be that way. There is also a quantity of goodwill beinggenerated, and that could become fertile ground for a more responsive future. 

We have offered enactionas a form of science that may help bridge the communication gap betweenexperience and science. It will not do this automatically. Ideas such as thelived body and enaction can easily become merely a romanticization of the oldparadigm of a corporeal form limited to self-survival and self-aggrandizement;on the other hand, such ideas could be a transition to a new paradigm for whatbody and mind are altogether. The key to progress is to keep an open mind—andwhile we are at it, it would not hurt to also have an open heart. Actually thatis good advice for doing anything, including reading this book. So bon voyage,and enjoy!

# Acknowledgments 

The inspiration for thisbook began in the late seventies when Francisco Varela was teaching at thesummer Science Program of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. NaropaInstitute tried to create an intellectual space for a dialogue between thecognitive sciences and the Buddhist traditions of meditative psychology andphilosophy by offering a variety of courses and by gathering teachers andstudents for discussion in an informal atmosphere. In this enterprise and inthe ideas that grew from it, the contributions of Newcomb Greenleaf, RobinKornman, Jeremy Hayward, Michael Moerman, Joseph Goguen, and Charlotte Lindewere invaluable. In 1979, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded what wasprobably the very first conference on “Contrasting Perspectives on Cognition:Buddhism and the Cognitive Sciences.” This conference, which gathered scholarsfrom various universities in North America and Buddhist scholars from manyschools and traditions, was so unsuccessful in establishing a genuine dialoguethat we learned a great deal about how not to go about the exploration. 

Over the next few yearsFrancisco Varela continued to work privately on developing the dialogue betweencognitive science and the Buddhist tradition, only occasionally presentingideas in public. One particularly helpful discussion took place as a series oftalks given in 1985 at Karma Choeling in Vermont. 

The overall shape ofthis book first came into being when Evan Thompson, supported by a research grantfrom the Stiftung Zur Förderung der Philosophie (Germany), joined FranciscoVarela at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in the summer of 1986. During thistime a tentative first draft of the book was completed. We are grateful to theStiftung and to Uri Kuchinsky for support during this period. 

In the fall of 1987, theideas of this first draft were presented at another conference on cognitivescience and Buddhism, this one held at the Cathedral Church of St. John theDivine in New York City and organized by the Lindisfarne Program for Biology,Cognition, and Ethics. We are especially grateful to William I. Thompson and tothe Very Reverend James Parks Morton for their interest and support of ourwork. 

From 1987 to 1989,Varela and Thompson continued writing in Paris, supported by grants to theLindisfarne Program for Biology, Cognition, and Ethics from the PrinceCharitable Trusts of Chicago. In the fall of 1989, Eleanor Rosch, who had beenteaching and doing research in both cognitive psychology and Buddhistpsychology for many years at Berkeley, joined the project as a third author. In1990–91, Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, working sometimes together and sometimesat a distance in Berkeley, Paris, Toronto, and Boston, produced several furtherdrafts, resulting finally in this book. 

Over the years, a greatmany people have encouraged and supported our work. William I. Thompson, AmyCohen, and Jeremy Hayward were untiring in their advice, encouragement, andfriendly criticism on virtually every aspect of the book. The comments andsupport of Mauro Cerutti, Jean-Pierre Depuy, Fernando Flores, Gordon Globus,and Susan Oyama were also especially helpful. Several other people read variousdrafts and/or portions of the manuscript and offered valuable comments: inparticular, Dan Dennett, Gail Fleischaker, Tamar Gendler, Dan Goleman, and LisaLloyd. Finally, special thanks are due to Frank Urbanowski of The MIT Press forbelieving in this book, and to Madeline Sunley and Jenya Weinreb for their carein handling the revisions and production. 

In addition to those already mentioned, each of us wishes to addseveral personal acknowledgments:

# Introduction 

This book begins andends with the conviction that the new sciences of mind need to enlarge theirhorizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities fortransformation inherent in human experience. Ordinary, everyday experience, onthe other hand, must enlarge its horizon to benefit from the insights andanalyses that are distinctly wrought by the sciences of mind. It is thispossibility for circulation between the sciences of mind (cognitive science)and human experience that we explore in this book. 

If we examine thecurrent situation today, with the exception of a few largely academicdiscussions cognitive science has had virtually nothing to say about what itmeans to be human in everyday, lived situations. On the other hand, those humantraditions that have focused on the analysis, understanding, and possibilitiesfor transformation of ordinary life need to be presented in a context thatmakes them available to science. 

We like to consider ourjourney in this book as a modern continuation of a program of research foundedover a generation ago by the French philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty.[1](#1_1) By continuation we do notmean a scholarly consideration of Merleau-Ponty’s thought in the context ofcontemporary cognitive science. We mean, rather, that Merleau-Ponty’s writingshave both inspired and guided our orientation here. 

We hold withMerleau-Ponty that Western scientific culture requires that we see our bodiesboth as physical structures and as lived, experiential structures—in short, asboth “outer” and “inner,” biological and phenomenological. These two sides ofembodiment are obviously not opposed. Instead, we continuously circulate backand forth between them. Merleau-Ponty recognized that we cannot understand thiscirculation without a detailed investigation of its fundamental axis, namely,the embodiment of knowledge, cognition, and experience. For Merleau-Ponty, asfor us, embodiment has this double sense: itencompasses both the body as a lived, experiential structure and the body asthe context or milieu of cognitive mechanisms. 

Embodiment in thisdouble sense has been virtually absent from cognitive science, both inphilosophical discussion and in hands-on research. We look to Merleau-Ponty,then, because we claim that we cannot investigate the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience without making this double sense ofembodiment the focus of our attention. This claim is not primarilyphilosophical. On the contrary, our point is that both the development ofresearch in cognitive science and the relevance of this research to lived humanconcerns require the explicit thematization of this double sense of embodiment.This book is meant as a first step in this task. 

Although we look toMerleau-Ponty for inspiration, we nonetheless recognize that our present-daysituation is significantly different from his. There are at least two reasonsfor this difference, one from science and the other from human experience. 

First, in the days whenMerleau-Ponty undertook his work—the 1940s and 1950s—the potential sciences ofmind were fragmented into disparate, noncommunicating disciplines: neurology,psychoanalysis, and behaviorist experimental psychology. Today we see theemergence of a new interdisciplinary matrix called cognitive science, whichincludes not only neuroscience but cognitive psychology, linguistics,artificial intelligence, and, in many centers, philosophy. Furthermore, most ofcognitive technology, which is essential for thecontemporary science of mind, has been developed only in the past fortyyears—the digital computer being the most significant example. 

Second, Merleau-Ponty addressedthe lived world of human experience from the philosophical standpointelaborated in the tradition of phenomenology. There are many direct heirs tophenomenology in the contemporary scene. In France, the tradition of Heideggerand Merleau-Ponty is continued in authors such as Michel Foucault, JacquesDerrida, and Pierre Bourdieu.[2](#2_1) In North America, Hubert Dreyfus has long been theHeideggerian gadfly of the cognitive science enterprise,[3](#3_1)more recently joined in that critique by others who link it to variousscientific domains, such as Terry Winograd, Fernando Flores,[4](#4_1)Gordon Globus,[5](#5_1) and John Haugeland.[6](#6_1)In another direction, phenomenology as ethnomethodology has been recentlypursued in the studies of improvisation by D. Sudnow.[7](#7_1)Finally, phenomenology has given its name to a tradition within clinicalpsychology.[8](#c0_note_8) These approaches, however, aredependent upon the methods of their parent disciplines—the logicalarticulations of philosophy, interpretive analysis of history and of sociology,and the treatment of patients in therapy. 

Despite this activity,phenomenology remains—especially in North America, where an important volume ofcurrent research in cognitive science is being done—a relatively uninfluentialphilosophical school. We believe that it is time for a radically new approachto the implementation of Merleau-Ponty’s vision. What we are offering in thisbook is thus a new lineage of descent from the fundamental intuition of doubleembodiment first articulated by Merleau-Ponty. 

What challenges doeshuman experience face as a result of the scientific study of mind? Theexistential concern that animates our entire discussion in this book resultsfrom the tangible demonstration within cognitive science that the self orcognizing subject is fundamentally fragmented, divided, or nonunified. Thisrealization is, of course, not new to Western culture. Many philosophers,psychiatrists, and social theorists since Nietzsche have challenged ourreceived conception of the self or subject as the epicenter of knowledge,cognition, experience, and action. The emergence of this theme within science,however, marks a quite significant event, for science provides the voice ofauthority in our culture to an extent that is matched by no other humanpractice and institution. Furthermore, science—again unlike other humanpractices and institutions—incarnates its understanding in technological artifacts.In the case of cognitive science, these artifacts are ever more sophisticatedthinking/acting machines, which have the potential to transform everyday lifeperhaps even more than the books of the philosopher, the reflections of thesocial theorist, or the therapeutic analyses of the psychiatrist. 

This central andfundamental issue—the status of the self or cognizing subject—could, of course,be relegated to a purely theoretical pursuit. Nevertheless, this issueobviously touches our lives and self-understanding directly. It is thereforenot at all surprising that those few eloquent books that do engage this issue,such as Hofstadter and Dennett’s The Mind’s Eye andSherry Turkle’s The Second Self, meet withconsiderable popularity.[9](#9_1) In a more academic vein, the circulation betweenscience and experience has surfaced in discussions of “folk psychology” or informs of investigation such as “conversational analysis.” An even moresystematic attempt to address the relation between science and experience canbe found in the recent book by Ray Jackendoff, Consciousnessand the Computational Mind,[10](#10_1)which addresses the relation between science and experience by attempting toprovide a computational foundation for the experience of conscious awareness. 

Although we share theconcerns of these various works, we remain dissatisfied with both theirprocedures and their answers. Our view is that the current style ofinvestigation is limited and unsatisfactory, both theoretically andempirically, because there remains no direct, hands-on, pragmaticapproach to experience with which to complement science. As a result, both thespontaneous and more reflective dimensions of human experience receive littlemore than a cursory, matter-of-fact treatment, one that is no match for thedepth and sophistication of scientific analysis. 

How do we propose toremedy this situation? Considerable evidence gathered in many contexts throughouthuman history indicates both that experience itself can be examined in adisciplined manner and that skill in such an examination can be considerablyrefined over time. We refer to the experience accumulated in a tradition thatis not familiar to most Westerners but that the West can hardly continue toignore—the Buddhist tradition of meditative practice and pragmatic,philosophical exploration. Though considerably less familiar than otherpragmatic investigations of human experience, such as psychoanalysis, theBuddhist tradition is especially relevant to our concerns, for, as we shallsee, the concept of a nonunified or decentered (the usual terms are egoless or selfless) cognitivebeing is the cornerstone of the entire Buddhist tradition. Furthermore, thisconcept—although it certainly entered into philosophical debate in the Buddhisttradition—is fundamentally a firsthand experiential account by those who attaina degree of mindfulness of their experience in daily life. For these reasons,then, we propose to build a bridge between mind in science and mind inexperience by articulating a dialogue between these two traditions of Westerncognitive science and Buddhist meditative psychology. 

Let us emphasize thatthe overriding aim of our book is pragmatic. We do not intend to build somegrand, unified theory, either scientific or philosophical, of the mind-bodyrelation. Nor do we intend to write a treatise of comparative scholarship. Ourconcern is to open a space of possibilities in which the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience can be fully appreciated and to fosterthe transformative possibilities of human experience in a scientific culture.This pragmatic orientation is common to both partners in this book. On the onehand, science proceeds because of its pragmatic link to the phenomenal world;indeed, its validation is derived from the efficacy of this link. On the otherhand, the tradition of meditative practice proceeds because of its systematicand disciplined link to human experience. The validation of this tradition isderived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience andself-understanding. 

In writing this book, wehave aimed for a level of discussion that will be accessible to severalaudiences. Thus we have attempted to address not only working cognitivescientists but also educated laypersons with a general interest in the dialoguebetween science and experience, as well as those interested in Buddhist orcomparative thought. As a result, members of these different (and, we hope,overlapping) groups may occasionally wish that we had devoted more time to somespecific point in the scientific, philosophical, or comparative discussions. Wehave tried to anticipate a few of these points but have placed our comments innotes and appendixes so as not to detract from the flow of the discussion,which, once again, is intended for a wide audience. 

Now that we haveintroduced the reader to the main theme of this book, let us outline how itunfolds into five parts: 

·     Part I introduces the two partnersin our dialogue. We indicate what we mean by “cognitive science” and “humanexperience” and proide an overview of how the dialogue between these twopartners will develop. 

·     Part II presents the computationalmodel of mind, which gave rise to cognitive science in its classical form(cognitivism). Here we see how cognitive science uncovers the nonunity of thecognizing subject and how the progressive realization of a nonunified selfprovides the cornerstone of Buddhist meditative practice and of itspsychological articulation. 

·     Part III addresses the issue ofhow the phenomena usually attributed to a self could arise without an actualself. Within cognitive science, this encompasses the concepts of self-organizationand emergent properties of cognitive processes, especially in connectionist models. Within Buddhist psychology, it includes theemergent structure of mental factors within a single moment of experience andthe emergence of the karmic causal patterning of experience over time. 

·     Part IV provides a further step,which consists in the presentation of a new approach in cognitive science. Wepropose the term enactive for this new approach. Inthe enactive program, we explicitly call into question the assumption—prevalentthroughout cognitive science—that cognition consists of the representation of aworld that is independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities by acognitive system that exists independent of the world. We outline instead aview of cognition as embodied action and so recoverthe idea of embodiment that we invoked above. We also situate this view ofcognition within the context of evolutionary theory by arguing that evolutionconsists not in optimal adaptation but rather in what we call natural drift.This fourth step in our book may be the most creative contribution we have tooffer to contemporary cognitive science. 

·     Part V considers the philosophicaland experiential implications of the enactive view that cognition has noultimate foundation or ground beyond its history of embodiment. We firstsituate these implications within the context of the contemporary Westerncritique of objectivism and foundationalism. We then present what was probablythe most radically nonfoundationalist understanding in human history, theMadhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, the school on whose insights all majorsubsequent Buddhist thought has relied. We conclude our discussion byconsidering some of the more far-reaching ethical implications of the journeyundertaken in this book. Part V may be the most creative contribution that wehave to make within our larger cultural context. 

We intend these fiveparts to express an ongoing conversation in which we explore experience and themind within an expanded horizon that includes both the meditative attention toexperience in daily life and the scientific attention to mind in nature. Thisconversation is ultimately motivated by a concern: without embracing therelevance and importance of everyday, lived human experience, the power andsophistication of contemporary cognitive science could generate a dividedscientific culture in which our scientific conceptions of life and mind on theone hand, and our everyday, lived self-understanding on the other, becomeirreconciliable. Hence in our eyes, the issues at hand, though scientific andtechnical, are inseparable from deeply ethical concerns, ones that require anequally deep reunderstanding of the dignity of human life.

# [1 ]()AFundamental Circularity: In the Mind of the Reflective Scientist 

## AnAlready-Given Condition 

A phenomenologicallyinclined cognitive scientist reflecting on the origins of cognition mightreason thus: Minds awaken in a world. We did not design our world. We simplyfound ourselves with it; we awoke both to ourselves and to the world weinhabit. We come to reflect on that world as we grow and live. We reflect on aworld that is not made, but found, and yet it is also our structure thatenables us to reflect upon this world. Thus in reflection we find ourselves ina circle: we are in a world that seems to be there before reflection begins,but that world is not separate from us. 

For the Frenchphilosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the recognition of this circle opened up aspace between self and world, between the inner and the outer. This space wasnot a gulf or divide; it embraced the distinction between self and world, andyet provided the continuity between them. Its openness revealed a middle way,an entre-deux. In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty wrote, 

When I begin to reflect, my reflection bears upon an unreflectiveexperience, moreover my reflection cannot be unaware of itself as an event, andso it appears to itself in the light of a truly creative act, of a changedstructure of consciousness, and yet it has to recognize, as having priorityover its own operations, the world which is given to the subject because thesubject is given to himself. … Perception is not a science of the world, it isnot even an act, a deliberate taking up of a position; it is the backgroundfrom which all acts stand out, and is presupposed by them: The world is not anobject such that I have in my possession the law of its making; it is thenatural setting of, and field for, all my thoughts and all my explicitperceptions.[1](#1_3) 

And toward the end ofthe book, he wrote, “The world is inseparable from the subject, but from asubject which is nothing but a project of the world, and the subject isinseparable from the world, but from a world which the subject itselfprojects.”[2](#2_3) 

Science (and philosophyfor that matter) has chosen largely to ignore what might lie in such anentre-deux or middle way. Indeed, Merleau-Ponty could be held partlyresponsible, for in his Phenomenology at least, hesaw science as primarily unreflective; he argued that it naively presupposedmind and consciousness. Indeed, this is one of the extreme stances science cantake. The observor that a nineteenth-century physicist had in mind is oftenpictured as a disembodied eye looking objectively at the play of phenomena. Orto change metaphors, such an observor could be imagined as a cognizing agentwho is parachuted onto the earth as an unknown, objective reality to becharted. Critiques of such a position, however, can easily go to the oppositeextreme. The indeterminacy principle in quantum mechanics, for example, isoften used to espouse a kind of subjectivism in which the mind on its own“constructs” the world. But when we turn back upon ourselves to make our owncognition our scientific theme—which is precisely what the new science of cognition purports to do—neither of these positions (theassumption of a disembodied observor or of a dis-worlded mind) is at alladequate. 

We will return to adiscussion of this point shortly. At the moment, we wish to speak moreprecisely about this science that has come to take such a turn. What is thisnew branch of science? 

## WhatIs Cognitive Science? 

In its widest sense theterm cognitive science is used to indicate that thestudy of mind is in itself a worthy scientific pursuit.[3](#3_3)At this time cognitive science is not yet established as a mature science. Itdoes not have a clearly agreed upon sense of direction and a large number ofresearchers constituting a community, as is the case with, say, atomic physicsor molecular biology. Rather, it is really more of a loose affiliation of disciplinesthan a discipline of its own. Interestingly, an important pole is occupied byartificial intelligence—thus the computer model of the mind is a dominantaspect of the entire field. The other affiliated disciplines are generallytaken to consist of linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, sometimesanthropology, and the philosophy of mind. Each discipline would give a somewhatdifferent answer to the question of what is mind or cognition, an answer thatwould reflect its own specific concerns. The future development of cognitivescience is therefore far from clear, but what has already been produced has hada distinct impact, and this may well continue to be the case. 

From Alexandre Koyré toThomas Kuhn, modern historians and philosophers have argued that scientificimagination mutates radically from one epoch to another and that the history ofscience is more like a novelistic saga than a linear progression. In otherwords, there is a human history of nature, a story that is well worth tellingin more than one way. Alongside such a human history of nature there is acorresponding history of ideas about human self-knowledge. Consider, forexample, Greek physics and the Socratic method or Montaigne’s essays and earlyFrench science. This history of self-knowledge in the West remains to be fullyexplored. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that precursors of what we now callcognitive science have been with us all along, since the human mind is theclosest and most familiar example of cognition and knowledge. 

In this parallel historyof mind and nature, the modern phase of cognitive science may represent adistinct mutation. At this time, science (i.e., the collection of scientistswho define what science must be) not only recognizes that the investigation of knowledgeitself is legitimate but also conceives of knowledge in a broad,interdisciplinary perspective, well beyond the traditional confines ofepistemology and psychology. This mutation, only some thirty years old, wasdramatically introduced through the “cognitivist” program (discussed later),much as the Darwinian program inaugurated the scientific study of evolutioneven though others had been concerned with evolution before. 

Furthermore, throughthis mutation, knowledge has become tangibly and inextricably linked to atechnology that transforms the social practices which make that very knowledgepossible—artificial intelligence being the most visible example. Technology,among other things, acts as an amplifier. One cannot separate cognitive scienceand cognitive technology without robbing one or the other of its vitalcomplementary element. Through technology, the scientific exploration of mindprovides society at large with an unprecedented mirror of itself, well beyondthe circle of the philosopher, the psychologist, the therapist, or anyindividual seeking insight into his own experience. 

This mirror reveals thatfor the first time Western society as a whole is confronted in its everydaylife and activities with such issues as: Is mind a manipulation of symbols? Canlanguage be understood by a machine? These concerns directly touch people’slives; they are not merely theoretical. Thus it is hardly surprising that thereis a constant interest in the media about cognitive science and its associated technology and that artificial intelligencehas deeply penetrated the minds of the young through computer games and sciencefiction. This popular interest is a sign of a deep transformation: Formillennia human beings have had a spontaneous understanding of their ownexperience—one embedded in and nourished by the larger context of their timeand culture. Now, however, this spontaneous folk understanding has becomeinextricably linked to science and can be transformed by scientificconstructions. 

Many deplore this event,while others rejoice. What is undeniable is that the event is happening, and atan ever increasing speed and depth. We feel that the creative interpenetrationamong research scientists, technologists, and the general public holds apotential for the profound transformation of human awareness. We find thispossibility fascinating and see it as one of the most interesting adventuresopen to everyone today. We offer this book as (we hope) a meaningfulcontribution to that transformative conversation. 

Throughout this book, wewill emphasize the diversity of visions within cognitive science. In our eyes,cognitive science is not a monolithic field, though it does have, as does anysocial activity, poles of domination so that some of its participating voicesacquire more force than others at various periods of time. Indeed, thissociological aspect of cognitive science is striking, for the “cognitiverevolution” of the past four decades was strongly influenced through specificlines of research and funding in the United States. 

Nevertheless, our biashere will be to emphasize diversity. We propose to look at cognitive science asconsisting of three successive stages. These three stages will be taken up inparts II, III, and IV respectively. But to help orient the reader, we willprovide a short overview of these stages here. We have drawn them in the formof a “polar” map with three concentric rings ([figure 1.1](#fig_001)). The three stagescorrespond to the successive movement from center to periphery; each ringindicates an important shift in the theoretical framework within cognitivescience. Moving around the circle, we have placed the major disciplines thatconstitute the field of cognitive science. Thus we have a conceptual chart inwhich we can place the names of various researchers whose work is bothrepresentative and will appear in the discussion that follows.

We begin in part II withthe center or core of cognitive science, known generally as cognitivism.[4](#4_3) The central tool and guidingmetaphor of cognitivism is the digital computer. A computer is a physicaldevice built in such a way that a particular set of its physical changes can beinterpreted as computations. A computation is an operation performed or carriedout on symbols, that is, on elements that representwhat they stand for. (For example, the symbol “7” represents the number 7.)Simplifying for the moment, we can say that cognitivism consists in thehypothesis that cognition—human cognition included—is the manipulation ofsymbols after the fashion of digital computers. In other words, cognition is mental representation: the mind is thought to operate bymanipulating symbols that represent features of the world or represent theworld as being a certain way. According to this cognitivist hypothesis, thestudy of cognition qua mental representation provides the proper domain ofcognitive science, a domain held to be independent of neurobiology at one endand sociology and anthropology at the other. 

Cognitivism has thevirtue of being a well-defined research program, complete with prestigiousinstitutions, journals, applied technology, and international commercialconcerns. We refer to it as the center or core of cognitive science because itdominates research to such an extent that it is often simply taken to becognitive science itself. In the past few years, however, several alternativeapproaches to cognition have appeared. These approaches diverge fromcognitivism along two basic lines of dissent: (1) a critique of symbolprocessing as the appropriate vehicle for representations, and (2) a critiqueof the adequacy of the notion of representation as the Archimedes point forcognitive science. 

The first alternative, which we call emergenceand explore more fully in part III, is typically referred to as connectionism.This name is derived from the idea that many cognitive tasks (such as visionand memory) seem to be handled best by systems made up of many simplecomponents, which, when connected by the appropriate rules, give rise to globalbehavior corresponding to the desired task. Symbolic processing, however, islocalized. Operations on symbols can be specified using only the physical formof the symbols, not their meaning. Of course, it is this feature of symbolsthat enables one to build a physical device to manipulate them. Thedisadvantage is that the loss of any part of the symbols or the rules for theirmanipulation results in a serious malfunction. Connectionist models generallytrade localized, symbolic processing for distributed operations (ones thatextend over an entire network of components) and so result in the emergence ofglobal properties resilient to local malfunction. For connectionists arepresentation consists in the correspondence between such an emergent globalstate and properties of the world; it is not a function of particular symbols. 

The second alternative,which we explore and defend in part IV, is born from a deeper dissatisfactionthan the connectionist search for alternatives to symbolic processing. Itquestions the centrality of the notion that cognition is fundamentallyrepresentation. Behind this notion stand three fundamental assumptions. Thefirst is that we inhabit a world with particular properties, such as length,color, movement, sound, etc. The second is that we pick up or recover theseproperties by internally representing them. The third is that there is aseparate subjective “we” who does these things. These three assumptions amountto a strong, often tacit and unquestioned, commitment to realism orobjectivism/subjectivism about the way the world is, what we are, and how wecome to know the world. 

Even the most hard-nosedbiologist, however, would have to admit that there are many ways that the worldis—indeed even many different worlds of experience—depending on the structureof the being involved and the kinds of distinctions it is able to make. Andeven if we restrict our attention to human cognition, there are many variousways the world can be taken to be.[5](#5_3)This nonobjectivist (and at best also nonsubjectivist) conviction is slowlygrowing in the study of cognition. As yet, however, this alternativeorientation does not have a well-established name, for it is more of anumbrella that covers a relatively small group of people working in diversefields. We propose as a name the term enactive toemphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of apregiven world by a pregiven mind but is rather the enactment of a world and amind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in theworld performs. The enactive approach takes seriously, then, the philosophicalcritique of the idea that the mind is a mirror of nature but goes further byaddressing this issue from within the heartland of science.[6](#6_3)

## Cognitive Science within the Circle 

We began this chapterwith a reflection on the fundamental circularity in scientific method thatwould be noted by a philosophically inclined cognitive scientist. From thestandpoint of enactive cognitive science, this circularity is central; it is anepistemological necessity. In contrast, the other, more extant forms ofcognitive science start from the view that cognition and mind are entirely dueto the particular structures of cognitive systems. The most obvious expressionof this view is found in neuroscience, where cognition is investigated bylooking at the properties of the brain. One can associate these biologicallybased properties with cognition only through behavior. It is only because thisstructure, the brain, undergoes interactions in an environment that we canlabel the ensuing behavior as cognitive. The basic assumption, then, is that toevery form of behavior and experience we can ascribe specific brain structures(however roughly). And, conversely, changes in brain structure manifestthemselves in behavioral and experiential alterations. We may diagram this viewas in [figure 1.2](#fig_002).(In this diagram and those that follow, the double arrows expressinterdependence or mutual specification.)

[Figure 1.5](#fig_005a) Interdependency of the background andembodiment. 

Yet upon reflection wecannot avoid as a matter of consistency the logical implication that by thissame view any such scientific description, either of biological or mentalphenomena, must itself be a product of the structure of our own cognitivesystem. We may diagram this further understanding as in [figure 1.3](#fig_003). 

Furthermore, the act ofreflection that tells us this does not come from nowhere; we find ourselvesperforming that act of reflection out of a given background (in theHeideggerian sense) of biological, social, and cultural beliefs and practices.[7](#7_3) We portray this further step as in[figure 1.4](#fig_004).

But then yet again, ourvery postulation of such a background is something that weare doing: we are here, living embodied beings,sitting and thinking of this entire scheme, including what we call abackground. So, in all rigor, we should caption our entire endeavor with yetanother layer indicating this embodiment here and now as in [figure 1.5](#fig_005). 

Plainly, this kind oflayering could go on indefinitely, as in an Escher drawing. This last movemakes it evident that, rather than adding layers of continued abstraction, we shouldgo back where we started, to the concreteness and particularity of our ownexperience—even in the endeavor of reflection. Thefundamental insight of the enactive approach as explored in this book is to beable to see our activities as reflections of a structure without losing sightof the directness of our own experience. 

 

## TheTheme of This Book 

This book is devoted tothe exploration of this deep circularity. We will endeavor throughout to keepin mind our theoretical constructs about structure without losing sight of theimmediacy of our experience. 

Some aspects of thebasic circularity of our condition have been discussed by philosophers invarious ways at least since Hegel. The contemporary philosopher Charles Taylorrefers to it when he says that we are “self-interpreting animals” and sowonders “whether features which are crucial to our self-understanding as agentscan be accorded no place in our explanatory theory.”[8](#8_2)The usual response on the part of cognitive scientists is well put by DanielDennett when he writes that “every cognitivist theory currently defended orenvisaged … is a theory of the sub-personal level. It is not at all clear tome, indeed, how a psychological theory—as distinct from a philosophicaltheory—could fail to be a sub-personal theory.”[9](#9_3)For Dennett, our self-understanding presupposes cognitive notions such asbelieving, desiring, and knowing but does not explain them. Therefore, if thestudy of mind is to be rigorous and scientific, it cannot be bound toexplanations in terms of features essential to our self-understanding. 

For the moment we wishsimply to emphasize the deep tension in our present world between science andexperience. In our present world science is so dominant that we give it theauthority to explain even when it denies what is most immediate and direct—oureveryday, immediate experience. Thus most people would hold as a fundamentaltruth the scientific account of matter/space as collections of atomicparticles, while treating what is given in their immediate experience, with allof its richness, as less profound and true. Yet when we relax into theimmediate bodily well-being of a sunny day or of the bodily tension ofanxiously running to catch a bus, such accounts of space/matter fade into thebackground as abstract and secondary. 

When it is cognition ormind that is being examined, the dismissal of experience becomes untenable,even paradoxical. The tension comes to the surface especially in cognitivescience because cognitive science stands at the crossroads where the naturalsciences and the human sciences meet. Cognitive science is thereforeJanus-faced, for it looks down both roads at once: One of its faces is turnedtoward nature and sees cognitive processes as behavior. The other is turnedtoward the human world (or what phenomenologists call the “life-world”) andsees cognition as experience. 

When we ignore thefundamental circularity of our situation, this double face of cognitive sciencegives rise to two extremes: we suppose either that our human self-understandingis simply false and hence will eventually be replaced by a mature cognitivescience, or we suppose that there can be no science of the human life-worldbecause science must always presuppose it. 

These two extremessummarize much of the general philosophical debate surrounding cognitivescience. At one end stand philosophers such as Stephen Stich and Paul andPatricia Churchland who argue that our self-understanding is simply false.[10](#10_3) (Note the Churchlands’ suggestionthat we might come to refer to brain states instead of experiences in actualdaily discourse.) At the other end stand philosophers such as Hubert Dreyfusand Charles Taylor who seriously doubt the very possibility of cognitivescience (perhaps because they often seem to accept the equation of cognitivescience with cognitivism).11 The debate thusrecapitulates—though with new twists—the typical oppositions within the humansciences. If, in the midst of this confusion, the fate of human experience hasbeen left to the philosophers, their lack of agreement does not bode well. 

Unless we move beyondthese oppositions, the rift between science and experience in our society willdeepen. Neither extreme is workable for a pluralistic society that must embraceboth science and the actuality of human experience. To deny the truth of ourown experience in the scientific study of ourselves is not only unsatisfactory;it is to render the scientific study of ourselves without a subject matter. Butto suppose that science cannot contribute to an understanding of our experiencemay be to abandon, within the modern context, the task of self-understanding.Experience and scientific understanding are like two legs without which wecannot walk. 

We can phrase this verysame idea in positive terms: it is only by having a sense of common groundbetween cognitive science and human experience that our understanding ofcognition can be more complete and reach a satisfying level. We thus propose aconstructive task: to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science to include thebroader panorama of human, lived experience in a disciplined, transformativeanalysis. As a constructive task, the search for this expansion becomesmotivated by scientific research itself, as we will see throughout this work.

# [2 ]()What Do We Mean “Human Experience”? 

## Scienceand the Phenomenological Tradition 

Our formulation in theprevious chapter obviously owes much to the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty. Weinvoke him because in our Western tradition he seems to be one of the few whosework was committed to an exploration of the fundamental entre-deux betweenscience and experience, experience and world. Another reason is thatMerleau-Ponty was committed to seeing this circularity from the vantage pointof what corresponded to cognitive science in his time—the emerging work inneuropsychology that was being pioneered in France. In his first major work, The Structure of Behavior,[1](#1_5)Merleau-Ponty argued for the mutual illumination among a phenomenology ofdirect lived experience, psychology, and neurophysiology. Clearly thiscomplementary style of work, the backbone of our concern in this book, was nottaken up much further. The scientific tradition moved west to a predominantlypositivist environment in the United States, and it is from there that themodem cognitive sciences familiar to us today were formed. We will come back tothese formative years of cognitive science in the next chapter. 

Throughout his writings,Merleau-Ponty drew on the earlier work of the German philosopher, EdmundHusserl. Husserl emphasized the importance of a direct examination ofexperience in a way that was radical, and yet deeply tied to the Western philosophicaltradition. Descartes had seen the mind as a subjective consciousness thatcontained ideas that corresponded (or sometimes failed to correspond) to whatwas in the world. This view of the mind as representing the world reached itsculmination in Franz Brentano’s notion of intentionality.According to Brentano, all mental states (perception, memory, etc.) are of or about something; in hiswords, mental states necessarily have “reference to a content” or “directiontoward an object” (which is not necessarily a thing in the world).[2](#2_5)This directedness or intentionality, Brentano claimed, was the definingcharacteristic of the mind. (This use of intentionalshould not be confused with its use to mean “doing something on purpose.”) 

Husserl was a student ofBrentano’s and extended his work. In one of his major works, Ideas: General Introduction to a Pure Phenomenology,[3](#3_5) published in 1913, Husserl tried todevelop a specific procedure for examining the structure of intentionality,which was the structure of experience itself, without any reference to thefactual, empirical world. He called this procedure “bracketing” (epoché), for it required that one put out of action, as ifin brackets, one’s ordinary judgments about the relation between experience andthe world. The standpoint from which these ordinary judgments are made Husserlcalled the “natural attitude”; it is the attitude generally known as “naive realism,”which consists in the conviction not only that the world is independent of mindor cognition but that things generally are the way they appear. By bracketingthe thesis of the natural attitude, Husserl claimed to be able to study theintentional contents of the mind purely internally, that is, without tracingthem back to what they seemed to refer to in the world. By this procedure heclaimed to have discovered a new domain that was prior to any empiricalscience. In Ideas, Husserl set out to explore thisnew domain by reflecting purely upon consciousness and discerning its essentialstructures. In a sort of philosophicalintrospection—which he called the “intuition of essences” (Wesenschau)—Husserltried to reduce experience to these essential structures and then show how ourhuman world was generated from them. 

Husserl thus took thefirst step of the reflective scientist: he claimed that to understandcognition, we cannot take the world naively but must see it instead as havingthe mark of our own structure. He also took the second step, at leastpartially, in realizing that that structure (the first step) was something thathe was cognizing with his own mind. In the philosophical fashion of his Westerntradition, however, he did not take the further steps we discussed in chapter1. He began with a solitary individual consciousness, took the structure he wasseeking to be entirely mental and accessible to consciousness in an act ofabstract philosophical introspection, and from there had great difficulty ingenerating the consensual, intersubjective world of human experience.[4](#4_5) And having no method other thanhis own philosophical introspection, he certainly could not take the final movewhich would return him to his experience, back to the beginning of the process.The irony of Husserl’s procedure, then, is that although he claimed to beturning philosophy toward a direct facing of experience, he was actuallyignoring both the consensual aspect and the direct embodied aspect ofexperience. (In this Husserl followed Descartes: he called his phenomenology atwentieth-century Cartesianism.) It is not surprising, therefore, that youngerEuropean philosophers turned increasingly away from pure phenomenology toembrace existentialism. 

Husserl recognized someof these problems in his later work. In his last work, TheCrisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology,[5](#5_5) he once more took up the task ofarticulating the basis and method of phenomenological reflection. Here,however, he explicitly focused on the experience of consciousness in what hecalled the “lived-world.” The lived world is not the naive, theoreticalconception of the world found in the natural attitude. It is, rather, theeveryday social world, in which theory is always directed toward some practicalend.[6](#6_5) Husserl argued that allreflection, all theoretical activity, including science, presupposes thelife-world as a background. The task of the phenomenologist now became theanalysis of the essential relation betweenconsciousness, experience, and this life-world. 

For Husserl, thisanalysis had to be undertaken for an additional reason: the role of thelife-world had become obscured by the dominance of the objectivist conceptionof science. Husserl referred to this view as the “Galilean style” in science,for it consists in taking the idealized formulations of mathematical physics asdescriptions of the way the world really is independent of the knowing subject.He disputed the equation of science in general with this specific style. Buthis argument was not directed against the scientific description of the worldper se. Indeed, he wished to revitalize the natural sciences against what heperceived to be the rising tide of irrationalism in philosophy (which he tookto be symptomatic of the “crisis” of European life in general). It was theequation of the Galilean style with all of science that obscured the relationbetween science and the life-world and so made impossible any philosophicalgrounding of the claims of the empirical sciences. 

The solution to theproblem, Husserl thought, was to expand the notion of science to include a newscience of the life-world—pure phenomenology—which would link science andexperience without succumbing to the objectivism of the Galilean style on theone hand and the irrationalism of existentialism on the other. 

## The Breakdown of Phenomenology 

Even in The Crisis, Husserl insisted that phenomenology is thestudy of essences. Thus the analysis of the life-world that he undertook therewas not anthropological or historical; it was philosophical. But if alltheoretical activity presupposes the life-world, what, then, of phenomenology?It is a distinctly theoretical pursuit; indeed, Husserl claimed it is the veryhighest form of theory. But then phenomenology too must presuppose thelife-world, even as it attempts to explicate it. Thus Husserl was being hauntedby the untraversed steps of the fundamental circularity. 

Husserl recognized someof this circularity and tried to deal with it in an interesting way. He arguedthat the life-world was really a set of sedimented, background preunderstandings or (roughly speaking) assumptions, whichthe phenomenologist could make explicit and treat as a system of beliefs. Inother words, Husserl tried to break out of the circle by treating thebackground as consisting essentially of representations.[7](#7_5)Once the life-world is construed in this way, however, Husserl’s claim (indeed,the central claim of phenomenology) that the life-world is always prior toscience becomes unstable. If the background consists of representations, whatis to prevent scientific knowledge from permeating the background andcontributing to its tacit store of beliefs? And if such permeation is possible,then what happens to the priority of phenomenology? 

Husserl must haverecognized these problems because he argued both that the life-world is priorto science and that our Western tradition is unique because our life-world ispermeated by science. The task of the phenomenologist was to move back from ananalysis of our scientifically permeated life-world to the “original” or“pregiven” life-world. But Husserl held on to the idea that this originallife-world could be exhaustively accounted for by tracing it back to theessential structures of consciousness. He thus embraced the peculiar thoughtthat the phenomenologist could stand both inside and outside of the life-world:he stood inside because all theory presupposed the life-world, and yet he stoodoutside because phenomenology alone could trace the genesis of the life-worldin consciousness. Indeed, phenomenology was the highest form of theory forHusserl precisely because it was capable of such a peculiar contortion.[8](#8_4) 

Given this peculiarcontortion, it is not surprising that Husserl’s pure phenomenology was not (ashe hoped it would be) cultivated and improved on from one generation to thenext, unlike other methodological discoveries such as the methods forstatistical inference. Indeed, it has been the headache of later commentatorsto find out just exactly how his method of “phenomenological reduction” is toproceed. 

But there is a deeperreason for the failure of the Husserlian project that we wish to emphasizehere: Husserl’s turn toward experience and “the things themselves” was entirelytheoretical, or, to make the point the other wayaround, it completely lacked any pragmatic dimension.It is hardly surprising, therefore, that it could not overcome the rift betweenscience and experience, for science, unlike phenomenological reflection, has alife beyond theory. Thus although Husserl’s turn toward a phenomenologicalanalysis of experience seemed radical, it was, in fact, quite within themainstream of Western philosophy. 

Indeed, this criticismwould hold even for Heidegger’s existential phenomenology, as well as forMerleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of lived experience. Both stressed the pragmatic,embodied context of human experience, but in a purely theoretical way. Despitethe fact that one of Heidegger’s chief arguments against Husserl was theimpossibility of separating lived experience from the consensual background ofcultural beliefs and practices, despite the fact that in a Heideggeriananalysis one cannot, strictly speaking, speak of ahuman mind at all apart from that background, still Heidegger consideredphenomenology the true method of ontology, a theoretical inquiry into humanexistence (Dasein) that was logically prior to anyform of scientific investigation. Merleau-Ponty took Heidegger one step furtherby applying Heidegger’s own criticism to phenomenology itself as well as toscience. In Merleau-Ponty’s view, both science and phenomenology explicated ourconcrete, embodied existence in a manner that was always after the fact. Itattempted to grasp the immediacy of our unreflective experience and tried togive voice to it in conscious reflection. But precisely by being a theoreticalactivity after the fact, it could not recapture the richness of experience; itcould be only a discourse about that experience. Merleau-Ponty admitted this inhis own way by saying that his task was infinite.[9](#9_5)

Within our Westerntradition, phenomenology was and still is thephilosophy of human experience, the only extant edifice of thought thataddresses these issues head-on. But above all, it was and still is philosophyas theoretical reflection. In most of the Western tradition since the Greeks,philosophy has been the discipline that seeks to find the truth, including thetruth about the mind, purely by means of abstract, theoretical reasoning. Evenphilosophers who critique or problematize reason do so only by means ofarguments, demonstrations, and—especially in our so-called postmodernera—linguistic exhibitions (i.e., by means of abstract thought).Merleau-Ponty’s critique of science and phenomenology, that they are theoreticalactivities after the fact, can equally be applied to most of Western philosophyas theoretical reflection. In this way, the loss of faith in reason so rampantin current thought becomes simultaneously a loss of faith in philosophy. 

But if we turn away fromreason, if reason is no longer taken as the method for knowing the mind, whatcan be used instead? One alternative is unreason,and, in the form of psychoanalytic theory, it has probably come to have moreinfluence on our Western folk conception of the mind than any other singlecultural factor. People—certainly middle-class North Americans andEuropeans—have come to believe that they have an unconscious that isdevelopmentally and symbolically primitive. They believe that both dreams andmuch of their waking life—motives, fantasies, preferences, aversions, emotions,behaviors, and pathological symptoms—are explainable by means of thisunconscious. Thus, in the folk view, to know the mind “from the inside” is touse some version of psychoanalytic method to delve into the unconscious. 

This “folkpsychoanalytic” view is subject to the same critique that Merleau-Ponty made ofscience and phenomenology. The psychoanalytic method works within anindividual’s conceptual system. Whether an individual is commenting on a freeassociation or using mathematical logic, having an ordinary waking conversationor dealing with the highly convoluted symbolic language of dreams, that personis knowing the mind and commenting on it in an after-the-fact fashion. The “professional”psychoanalyst knows, however, that he has to work within an individual’sconceptual system and that a method that no theory can substitute for isrequired to go beyond this stage. What we find particularly interesting aboutpsychoanalysis is that despite its great differences from cognitivescience—despite the fact that it deals with phenomena of mind that are quitedifferent from the normal subject matter of cognitive science and studies themby patently different methods—we see some of the same stages of evolution thatwe identify in cognitive science mirrored in psychoanalytic theory. We shallpoint to the convergences in future chapters. We hasten to add that suchpointing will only be in the spirit of providing place markers, as it were, notcarefully constructed bridges, since we do not have firsthand experiences in apsychoanalytic process. 

We are still in need ofa method, however. Where can we turn for a tradition that can provide anexamination of human experience in both its reflective and its immediate, livedaspects? 

## A Non-Western Philosophical Tradition 

At this point, a boldstep needs to be taken, one that takes us to the heart of what we have topresent: we need to enlarge our horizon to encompass non-Western traditions ofreflection upon experience. If philosophy in the West no longer occupies aprivileged, foundational position with respect to other cultural activitiessuch as science or art, then a full appreciation of philosophy and itsimportance for human experience requires that we examine the role of philosophyin cultures other than our own. In our culture, cognitive science has causedgreat excitement among philosophers (and the public at large) because it hasenabled them to see their tradition in a new light. Were we to entertain theidea that there is no hard-and-fast distinction between science and philosophy,then philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, and Husserlwould take on a new significance: they could be seen, among other things, asprotocognitive scientists. (Or as Jerry Fodor puts it, “In intellectualhistory, everything happens twice, first as philosophy and then as cognitivescience.”[10](#10_5)) Might this not also be the casefor philosophical traditions with which we are less familiar? 

In this book we willfocus on one such tradition, that which derives from the Buddhist method ofexamining experience called mindfulness meditation.We believe that the Buddhist doctrines of no-self and of nondualism that grewout of this method have a significant contribution to make in a dialogue withcognitive science: (1) The no-self doctrine contributes to understanding thefragmentation of self portrayed in cognitivism and connectionism. (2) Buddhistnondualism, particularly as it is presented in the Madhyamaka (which literallymeans “middle way”) philosophy of Nagarjuna, may be juxtaposed with theentre-deux of Merleau-Ponty and with the more recent ideas of cognition asenaction.[11](#11_2) 

It is our contentionthat the rediscovery of Asian philosophy, particularly of the Buddhisttradition, is a second renaissance in the cultural history of the West, withthe potential to be equally important as the rediscovery of Greek thought inthe European renaissance. Our Western histories of philosophy, which ignoreIndian thought, are artificial, since India and Greece share with us anIndo-European linguistic heritage as well as many cultural and philosophicalpreoccupations.[12](#12_1) 

There is, however, amore important reason for our interest. In the Indian tradition, philosophynever became a purely abstract occupation. It was tied (“yoked,” as istraditionally said) to specific disciplined methods for knowing—differentmethods of meditation. In particular, within the Buddhist tradition, the methodof mindfulness was considered fundamental. Mindfulness means that the mind ispresent in embodied everyday experience; mindfulness techniques are designed tolead the mind back from its theories and preoccupations, back from the abstractattitude, to the situation of one’s experience itself.[13](#13_1)Furthermore, and equally of interest in the modern context, the descriptionsand commentaries on mind that grew out of this tradition never became divorcedfrom living pragmatics: they were intended to inform an individual as to how tohandle his mind in personal and interpersonal situations, and they bothinformed and became embodied in the structure of communities. 

We are currently, in theWest, in an ideal position to study Buddhism in its fully embodied aspects.First, the current trend for global integration and the growing impact ofnon-Western traditions have made it possible to appreciate that the designationand delineation of “religion” in the West is itself a cultural artifact thatmay, if taken literally, seriously hamper our understanding of othertraditions. Second, in the last two decades Buddhism has actually taken root inWestern countries and has begun to flourish as a living tradition. We have ahistorically unique situation in which the many culturally diverse forms thatBuddhism assumed have been transplanted to the same geographical locations andare interacting with each other and with their host cultures. For example, insome of the large cities of North America and Europe,within walking distance of each other one might find centers representing allof the major forms of Buddhism in the world—the Theravadin traditions ofSoutheast Asia, the Mahayana forms from Vietnam, China, Korea, and Japan, andthe Vajrayana of Japan and Tibet. Whereas some centers represent religiousinstitutions of a particular ethnic immigrant population, many are composed ofWesterners who, under the guidance of traditionally sanctioned teachers, arepracticing and studying the form of Buddhism with which they are connected andare experimenting with how their particular teachings are to be acted outindividually and communally in the sociocultural context of the modern Westernworld. 

These factors are agreat boon to the contemporary study of Buddhism, whether by interestedindividuals, scholars, or by the social and cognitive sciences. Unlike theinitial introduction of Greek thought during the Renaissance, we are notdependent for our knowledge of Buddhist practices and ideas on theinterpretation of a few fragmentary, historical, hermeneutically isolatedtexts—we can observe what texts are actually taught, how they are interpretedand used, and how, in general, the meditations, practices, and explicitteachings of Buddhism are being transmitted within the living practices ofthese developing Buddhist communities. We will rely not only on scholarship butalso on these indigenous teachings in the presentations that follow.[14](#14_1) 

## ExaminingExperience with a Method: Mindfulness/Awareness 

There are many humanactivities of body and mind, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. The word meditation in its general usage in modern America has anumber of different prominent folk meanings:[15](#15_1)(1) a state of concentration in which consciousness is focused on only oneobject; (2) a state of relaxation that is psychologically and medicallybeneficial; (3) a dissociated state in which trance phenomena can occur; and(4) a mystical state in which higher realities or religious objects areexperienced. These are all altered states of consciousness; the meditator isdoing something to get away from his usual mundane, unconcentrated, unrelaxed,nondissociated, lower state of reality. 

Buddhistmindfulness/awareness practice is intended to be just the opposite of these.Its purpose is to become mindful, to experience what one’s mind is doing as itdoes it, to be present with one’s mind. What relevance does this have forcognitive science? We believe that if cognitive science is to include humanexperience, it must have some method for exploring and knowing what humanexperience is. It is for this reason that we are focusing on the Buddhisttradition of mindfulness meditation. 

To get a sense of whatmindfulness meditation is, one must first realize the extent to which peopleare normally not mindful. Usually one notices the tendency of the mind towander only when one is attempting to accomplish some mental task and thewandering interferes. Or perhaps one realizes that one has just finished ananticipated pleasurable activity without noticing it. In fact, body and mindare seldom closely coordinated. In the Buddhist sense, we are not present. 

How can this mind becomean instrument for knowing itself? How can the flightiness, the nonpresence ofmind be worked with? Traditionally, texts talk about two stages of practice:calming or taming the mind (Sanscrit: shamatha) andthe development of insight (Sanscrit: vipashyana).[16](#16_1) Shamatha, when used as a separatepractice, is in fact a concentration technique for learning to hold (“tether”is the traditional term) the mind to a single object. Such concentration couldeventually lead to states of blissful absorption; although such states wereassiduously cataloged within Buddhist psychology, they were not generallyrecommended. The purpose of calming the mind in Buddhism is not to becomeabsorbed but to render the mind able to be present with itself long enough togain insight into its own nature and functioning. (There are many traditionalanalogies for this process. For example, to be able to see paintings on thewall of a dark cave, one needs a good light protected from thewind.) Most present-day schools of Buddhism do not practice shamatha andvipashyana as separate techniques but rather combine the functions of calmingand of insight into a single meditation technique. (Some of the terminologicalconfusions that result are, we hope, clarified in appendix A). We will referhere to these types of meditation by their more experiential designations asmindfulness/awareness meditation. 

The description ofmindfulness/awareness meditation that follows is based on the writings and oralpresentations of traditional teachers and on observations, interviews, anddiscussions with present-day students of Buddhism from the major Buddhisttraditions. Typically mindfulness/awareness is trained by means of formalperiods of sitting meditation. The purpose of such periods is to simplify thesituation to the bare minimum. The body is put into an upright posture and heldstill. Some simple object, often the breath, is used as the focus of alertattention. Each time the meditator realizes that his mind is wanderingunmindfully, he is to acknowledge nonjudgmentally that wandering (there arevarious instructions as to how this is to be done) and bring the mind back toits object. 

Breathing is one of themost simple, basic, ever-present bodily activities. Yet beginning meditatorsare generally astonished at how difficult it is to be mindful of even souncomplex an object. Meditators discover that mind and body are notcoordinated. The body is sitting, but the mind is seized constantly bythoughts, feelings, inner conversations, daydreams, fantasies, sleepiness,opinions, theories, judgments about thoughts and feelings, judgments aboutjudgments—a never-ending torrent of disconnected mental events that themeditators do not even realize are occurring except at those brief instantswhen they remember what they are doing. Even when they attempt to return totheir object of mindfulness, the breath, they may discover that they are onlythinking about the breath rather than being mindful of the breath. 

Eventually, it begins todawn on the meditators that there is an actual difference between being presentand not being present. In daily life they also begin to have instants of wakingup to the realization that they are not present and of flashing back for amoment to be present—not to the breath, in this case, but to whatever is goingon. Thus the first great discovery of mindfulness meditation tends to be notsome encompassing insight into the nature of mind but the piercing realizationof just how disconnected humans normally are from their very experience. Eventhe simplest or most pleasurable of daily activities—walking, eating,conversing, driving, reading, waiting, thinking, making love, planning,gardening, drinking, remembering, going to a therapist, writing, dozing,emoting, sightseeing—all pass rapidly in a blur of abstact commentary as themind hastens to its next mental occupation. The meditator now discovers thatthe abstract attitude which Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty ascribe to science andphilosophy is actually the attitude of everyday life when one is not mindful.This abstract attitude is the spacesuit, the padding of habits andpreconceptions, the armor with which one habitually distances oneself fromone’s experience. 

From the point of viewof mindfulness/awareness meditation, humans are not trapped forever in theabstract attitude. The dissociation of mind from body, of awareness fromexperience, is the result of habit, and these habits can be broken. As themeditator again and again interrupts the flow of discursive thought and returnsto be present with his breath or daily activity, there is a gradual taming ofthe mind’s restlessness. One begins to be able to see the restlessness as suchand to become patient with it, rather than becoming automatically lost in it.[17](#17_1) Eventually meditators reportperiods of a more panoramic perspective. This is called awareness. At thispoint the breath is no longer needed as a focus. In one traditional analogy,mindfulness is likened to the individual words of a sentence, whereas awarenessis the grammar that encompasses the entire sentence. Meditators also reportexperiencing space and spaciousness of mind. A traditional metaphor for thisexperience is that mind is the sky (a nonconceptual background) in whichdifferent mental contents, like clouds, arise and subside. Experience ofpanoramic awareness and of space are natural outgrowths ofmindfulness/awareness meditation, since they begin to occur in meditators notonly in Buddhist traditions where they have doctrinal significance and wherethey are thus encouraged but also in those traditions where they are discouraged (some Theravadin schools) and where specificantidotes to them then need to be applied. In those traditions, the developmentof practice is focused on increased intensity of mindfulness. 

How is it thatmindfulness/awareness can develop? There are two traditional approaches totalking about this. In one, the development is treated as the training of goodhabits. The mental fact of mindfulness is being strengthened like the trainingof a muscle that can then perform harder and longer work without tiring. In theother approach, mindfulness/awareness is considered part of the basic nature ofthe mind; it is the natural state of mind that has been temporarily obscured byhabitual patterns of grasping and delusion. The untamed mind constantly triesto grasp some stable point in its unending movement and to cling to thoughts,feelings, and concepts as if they were a solid ground. As all these habits arecut through and one learns an attitude of letting go, the mind’s naturalcharacteristic of knowing itself and reflecting its own experience can shineforth. This is the beginning of wisdom or maturity (prajña).

It is important torealize that such maturity does not mean assuming the abstract attitude. AsBuddhist teachers often point out, knowledge, in the sense of prajña, is notknowledge about anything. There is no abstract knowerof an experience that is separate from the experience itself. Buddhist teachersoften talk of becoming one with one’s experience. What, then, are the contentsor discoveries of this wisdom? 

## TheRole of Reflection in the Analysis of Experience 

If the results ofmindfulness/awareness practice are to bring one closer to one’s ordinaryexperience rather than further from it, what can be the role of reflection? Oneof our popular cultural images of Buddhism is that the intellect is destroyed.In fact, study and contemplation play a major role in all Buddhist schools. Thespontaneous action, much dramatized in the popular image of the Zen master, isnot contradictory to the use of reflection as a mode of learning. How can thisbe? 

This question brings usto the methodological heart of the interaction between mindfulness/awarenessmeditation, phenomenology, and cognitive science. What we are suggesting is achange in the nature of reflection from an abstract, disembodied activity to anembodied (mindful), open-ended reflection. By embodied,we mean reflection in which body and mind have been brought together. What thisformulation intends to convey is that reflection is not just on experience, but reflection isa form of experience itself—and that reflective form of experience can beperformed with mindfulness/awareness. When reflection is done in that way, itcan cut the chain of habitual thought patterns and preconceptions such that itcan be an open-ended reflection, open to possibilities other than thosecontained in one’s current representations of the life space. We call this formof reflection mindful, open-ended reflection. 

In our usual trainingand practice as Western scientists and philosophers, we obviously proceeddifferently. We ask, “What is mind?,” “What is body?” and proceed to reflecttheoretically and to investigate scientifically. This procedure gives rise to agamut of claims, experiments, and results on various facets of cognitiveabilities. But in the course of these investigations we often forget just whois asking this question and how it is asked. By not including ourselves in thereflection, we pursue only a partial reflection, and our question becomesdisembodied; it attempts to express, in the words of the philosopher ThomasNagel, a “view from nowhere.”[18](#18_1) It is ironic that it is just thisattempt to have a disembodied view from nowhere that leads to having a viewfrom a very specific, theoretically confined, preconceptually entrappedsomewhere. 

The phenomenologicaltradition, from Husserl on, complained bitterly about this lack of self-included reflection but was able to offer in itsplace only a project of theoretical reflection onexperience. The other extreme is to include the self but abandon reflectionaltogether in favor of a naive, subjective impulsivity. Mindfulness/awarenessis neither of these; it works directly with, and so expresses, our basicembodiment. 

Let us see how thedifference in the theoretical and the mindfulness traditions of reflection manifestin an actual issue—the so-called mind-body problem. From Descartes on, theguiding question in Western philosophy has been whether body and mind are oneor two distinct substances (properties, levels of description, etc.) and whatthe ontological relation between them is. We have already seen the simple,experiential, pragmatic approach taken in mindfulness/awareness meditation. Itis a matter of simple experience that our mind and body can be dissociated,that the mind can wander, that we can be unaware of where we are and what ourbody or mind are doing.[19](#19_1) But this situation, this habit ofmindlessness, can be changed. Body and mind can be brought together. We candevelop habits in which body and mind are fully coordinated. The result is amastery that is not only known to the individual meditator himself but that isvisible to others—we easily recognize by its precision and grace a gesture thatis animated by full awareness. We typically associate such mindfulness with theactions of an expert such as an athlete or musician. 

We are suggesting thatDescartes’s conclusion that he was a thinking thing was the product of hisquestion, and that question was a product of specific practices—those of disembodied,unmindful reflection. Husserlian phenomenology, though it embraced experiencein a radical way, nonetheless continued the tradition by reflecting only uponthe essential structures of thought. And even though it has recently becomequite fashionable to criticize or “deconstruct” this standpoint of the cogito, philosophers still do not depart from the basic practice responsible for it. 

Theoretical reflectionneed not be mindless and disembodied. The basic assertion of this progressiveapproach to human experience is that the mind-body relation or modality is notsimply fixed and given but can be fundamentally changed. Many people wouldacknowledge the obvious truth of this conviction. Western philosophy does notdeny this truth so much as ignore it. 

To expand this point: Asis the case with mindfulness in general, there are two ways of talking aboutthe development of embodied reflection. One way—a preliminary or beginner’sapproach—is to liken it to the development of a skill. Take learning to play aflute. The description goes thus: One is shown the basic positions of thefingers, perhaps directly or in the form of a fingering chart. One thenpractices these notes in various combinations over and over until a basic skillis acquired. In the beginning, the relation between mental intention and bodilyact is quite undeveloped—mentally one knows what to do, but one is physicallyunable to do it. As one practices, the connection between intention and actbecomes closer, until eventually the feeling of difference between them isalmost entirely gone. One achieves a certain condition that phenomenologicallyfeels neither purely mental nor purely physical; it is, rather, a specific kindof mind-body unity. And, of course, there are many levels of possible interpretation,as can be seen in the variety of accomplished performers. 

Although such examplesmay seem compelling and although meditation instructions for beginnerssometimes make mindfulness sound like the development of a skill, descriptionof the process only in these terms can actually be quite misleading.Contemplative traditions from around the world agree that if one thinks thepoint of meditative practice is to develop special skills and make oneself intoa religious, philosophical, or meditative virtuoso, then one is engaging inself-deception and is actually going in the opposite direction. In particular,the practices involved in the development of mindfulness/awareness arevirtually never described as the training of meditative virtuosity (andcertainly not as the development of a higher, more evolved spirituality)[20](#20_1) but rather as the letting go ofhabits of mindlessness, as an unlearning rather thana learning. This unlearning may take training and effort, but it is a differentsense of effort from the acquiring of something new. It is precisely when themeditator approaches the development of mindfulness with the greatestambitions—the ambition to acquire a new skill throughdetermination and effort—that his mind fixates and races, andmindfulness/awareness is most elusive. This is why the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation talks about effortless efforts and why it usesthe analogy for meditation of tuning, rather than playing, a stringedinstrument—the instrument must be tuned neither too tightly nor too loosely.When the mindfulness meditator finally begins to let go rather than to struggleto achieve some particular state of activity, then body and mind are found tobe naturally coordinated and embodied. Mindful reflection is then found to be acompletely natural activity. The importance of the distinction between skilland letting go should become increasingly apparent as we continue our story. 

In summary it is becausereflection in our culture has been severed from its bodily life that themind-body problem has become a central topic for abstract reflection. Cartesiandualism is not so much one competing solution as it is the formulation of thisproblem. Reflection is taken to be distinctively mental, and so the problemarises of how it could ever be linked to bodily life. Although contemporarydiscussions of this problem have become quite sophisticated—largely because ofthe development of cognitive science—they have nevertheless not departed fromthe essentially Cartesian problematic of trying to understand how two seeminglydistinct things are related.[21](#21_1) (Whether these things aresubstances, properties, or merely levels of description rarely makes adifference to the basic structure of the discussion.) 

From the standpoint of amindful, open-ended reflection the mind-body question need not be, What is theontological relation between body and mind, regardless of anyone’sexperience?—but rather, What are the relations of body and mind in actualexperience (the mindfulness aspect), and how do these relations develop, whatforms can they take (the open-ended aspect)? As the Japanese philosopher YasuoYuasa remarks, “One starts from the experiential assumption that the mind-bodymodality changes through the training of the mind and body by means ofcultivation (shugyo) or training (keiko).Only after assuming this experiential ground does one ask what the mind-bodyrelation is. That is, the mind-body issue is not simply a theoreticalspeculation but it is originally a practical, lived experience (taiken), involving the mustering of one’s whole mind andbody. The theoretical is only a reflection on this lived experience.”[22](#22_1) 

We may notice that thisviewpoint is resonant with pragmatism, a view in philosophy that is having amodern revival.[23](#23_1) The body and mind relation isknown in terms of what it can do. When one takes the more abstract attitude inphilosophy or science, one might think that questions about the body-mindrelation can be answered only after one first satisfactorily determines what isbody and what is mind in isolation and abstraction. In the pragmatic,open-ended reflection, however, these questions are not separate from “themustering of one’s whole mind and body.” Such involvement prevents thequestion, What is mind? from becoming disembodied. When we include in ourreflection on a question the asker of the question and the process of askingitself (recall the fundamental circularity), then the question receives a newlife and meaning. 

Perhaps the closestdiscipline familiar to Westerners that verges on a pragmatic, open-ended viewtoward knowledge is psychoanalysis. We have in mind not so much the content ofpsychoanalytic theory but rather the idea that the very conception of mind andof the subject who is undergoing analysis is understood to change as the web ofrepresentations in which the self is entangled is slowly penetrated throughanalysis. What we believe traditional psychoanalytic methods lack, however, isthe mindfulness/awareness component of reflection. 

## Experimentation and Experiential Analysis 

The form most closelyallied to pragmatism in science is the experimental method. If one wants toknow how many teeth a horse has, one counts the teeth. More elaboratehypotheses are theoretically reduced to possible observations by means ofdeductive inferences. Although the philosophical theory of such experimentationhas been historically tied to an objectivist, disembodied view of knowledge, itneed not be. 

Canmindfulness/awareness meditation be considered a kind of experimentation thatmakes discoveries about the nature and behavior of mind—a kind ofexperimentation that is embodied and open-ended? As we have already mentioned,in mindfulness/awareness meditation one does not begin by trying to attain somespecific state (as in concentrations, relaxations, trances, or mysticallyoriented practices); rather, the goal is to be mindful of the mind as it takesits own course. By letting go of the mind in this way, the natural activity ofthe mind to be alert and observant becomes apparent. 

Buddhist doctrines layclaim to being simply the observations that mind makes when it is allowed to benaturally observant. Indeed, all of the Buddhist assertions (lack of self, thecodependent arising of experience, and so on) are treated by Buddhist teachersas discoveries rather than creeds or doctrines. Buddhist teachers are fond ofpointing out that students are always invited, indeed required, to doubt suchassertions and to test them directly in their own experience rather than toaccept them as beliefs. (Of course if they come up with a drastically deviantanswer, they might be invited to look again—much as it happens with scientificteaching in its normal form.) 

There are two objectionsthat could be raised to the claim that mindfulness/awareness is a means ofdiscovery about the nature of experience. In the first place, one might wonderabout the relationship between knowledge gained by means of meditation and theactivity that we call introspection. After all, introspectionism as a school ofpsychology, made popular by the nineteenth-century psychologist Wilhelm Wundt,failed definitively to provide a basis for experimental psychology. There wasno agreement at all among different laboratories of introspection on whatresults were yielded by the introspectionist method—the very antithesis ofscience. But what was this method called introspection? Each laboratory beganwith a theory that experience was decomposable into certain kinds of elements,and subjects were trained to decompose their experience in that fashion. Asubject was asked to look at his own experience as an outside observer would.This is, in fact, what we usually think of as introspection in daily life. Thisis the very essence of what Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger called the abstractattitude of the scientist and the philosopher. The mindfulness meditator wouldsay that the introspectionists were not actually aware of mind at all; theywere just thinking about their thoughts. Such an activity would, of course,serve only to display whatever preconceptions one is holding about the mind—nowonder different laboratories disagreed with one another. It is precisely tocut through the attitude of introspection that mindfulness/awareness meditationexists. 

The second objectionthat could be raised to mindfulness/awareness as a method of observation of themind in situ is that by meditating or becoming mindful and aware, one isdisrupting one’s normal mode of being in the world, one’s active involvementand one’s taken for granted sense of the world’s independent reality. How canmindfulness, then, give us any information about that normal mode of being thatit disrupts? Our answer is that this question, to have meaning, must itselfpresuppose the abstract attitude; one is reflecting back upon the active involvementand saying it is or is not disrupted as though this could be perceived fromsome independent, abstract vantage point of knowledge. From the Buddhistperspective, it is only by means of natural mindfulness that Heidegger andMerleau-Ponty could ever have known about a normal mode of active involvementin the world in the first place. (Merleau-Pontyvirtually says as much himself in his preface to Phenomenologyof Perception.) What mindfulness disrupts is mindlessness—that is, beingmindlessly involved without realizing that that is what one is doing. It isonly in this sense that the observation changes what is being observed, andthat is part of what we mean by open-ended reflection. 

In conclusion, we haveargued that it is necessary to have a disciplined perspective on humanexperience that can enlarge the domain of cognitive science to include directexperience. We suggest such a perspective already exists in the form ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. Mindfulness/awareness practice, phenomenologicalphilosophy, and science are human activities; each is an expression of ourhuman embodiment. Naturally, Buddhist doctrine, Western phenomenology, andscience are each heir to numerous doctrinal disputes and conflicting claims.Each, however, insofar as it is a form of experimentation, is open to everyoneand may be examined with the methods of each of the others. Thus, we believethat mindfulness/awareness meditation can provide a natural bridge betweencognitive science and human experience. Particularly impressive to us is theconvergence that we have discovered among some of the main themes of Buddhistdoctrine, phenomenology, and cognitive science—themes concerning the self andthe relation between subject and object. It is to these themes that we now turnin our journey of discovery.

[13.](#13) The word mindfulness hasrecently been used in a non-Buddhist and nonmeditative sense by the psychologistEllen Langer in her book Mindfulness. The basicBuddhist meaning of mindfulness is simply to be present with one’s experience.Langer uses the word to refer to the human ability to be thoughtful, ratherthan automatic, about one’s experience and actions, and to be cognizant ofalternative modes of construal of situations. From the Buddhist point of view,what Langer is describing is not mindfulness but rather, perhaps, being in the“human realm.” It is only in human states of mind thatone can reflect on one’s experience and consider alternatives. Other states ofmind, such as intense aggression (hell realm) or stupidity (animal realm) aretoo habitually automatic to allow reflection.

[II ]()Varieties ofCognitivism 

# [3 ]()Symbols: The Cognitivist Hypothesis 

## The Foundational Cloud 

Our exploration ofcognitive science and human experience begins in this chapter with anexamination of cognitivism—the center of our diagram in chapter 1—and itshistorical origins in the earlier, cybernetic era of cognitive science. Themain idea to be presented in part II is that the analysis of mind undertaken bycertain traditions of mindfulness/awareness provides a natural counterpart topresent-day cognitivist conceptions of mind. This chapter presents thecognitivist perspective; in the next chapter we will discuss some conclusions,in some respects similar, reached by means of mindfulness/awareness. 

Let us begin by lookingat the historical roots of present-day cognitivism. This short historicalexcursion is necessary, for a science that neglects its past is bound to repeatits mistakes and will be unable to visualize its development. Our excursionhere is, of course, not intended to be a comprehensive history but only totouch on those issues of direct relevance for our concerns here.[1](#1_7)

In fact, virtually allof the themes in present-day debates were already introduced in the formativeyears of cognitive science from 1943 to 1953. History indicates, then, thatthese themes are deep and hard to pursue. The “founding fathers” knew very wellthat their concerns amounted to a new science, and they christened this sciencewith the new name cybernetics. This name is no longerin current use, and many cognitive scientists today would not even recognizethe family connections. This lack of recognition is not idle. It reflects thefact that to become established as a science in its clear-cut cognitivistorientation, the future cognitive science had to sever itself from its roots,which were complex and entangled but also rich with possibilities for growth anddevelopment. Such a severance is often the case in the history of science: itis the price of passing from an exploratory stage to a full-fledged researchprogram—from a cloud to a crystal. 

The cybernetics phase ofcognitive science produced an amazing array of concrete results, in addition toits long-term (often underground) influence: 

·     The use of mathematical logic tounderstand the operation of the nervous system 

·     The invention ofinformation-processing machines (such as digital computers), thereby laying thebasis for artificial intelligence 

·     The establishment of themetadiscipline of systems theory, which has had an imprint in many branches ofscience, such as engineering (systems analysis, control theory), biology(regulatory physiology, ecology), social sciences (family therapy, structuralanthropology, management, urban studies), and economics (game theory) 

·     Information theory as astatistical theory of signal and communication channels 

·     The first examples ofself-organizing systems 

This list is impressive:we tend to consider many of these notions and tools an integral part of our lives. Yet they were all nonexistent before thisformative decade, and they were all produced by an intense exchange amongpeople of widely different backgrounds. Thus the work during this era was theresult of a uniquely and remarkably successful interdisciplinary effort. 

The avowed intention ofthis cybernetics movement was to create a science of mind. In the eyes of theleaders of this movement, the study of mental phenomena had been far too longin the hands of psychologists and philosophers. In contrast, thesecyberneticians felt a calling to express the processes underlying mentalphenomena in explicit mechanisms and mathematical formalisms.[2](#2_7)

One of the bestillustrations of this mode of thinking (and its tangible consequences) was theseminal 1943 paper by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, “A Logical Calculus ofIdeas Immanent in Nervous Activity.”[3](#3_7)Two major leaps were taken in this article: first, the proposal that logic isthe proper discipline with which to understand the brain and mental activity,and second, the claim that the brain is a device that embodies logicalprinciples in its component elements or neurons. Each neuron was seen as athreshold device, which could be either active or inactive. Such simple neuronscould then be connected to one another, their interconnections performing therole of logical operations so that the entire brain could be regarded as adeductive machine. 

These ideas were centralfor the invention of digital computers.[4](#4_7)At that time, vacuum tubes were used to implement the McCulloch-Pitts neuronswhereas today we find silicon chips, but modern computers are still built onthe same so-called von Neumann architecture that has been made familiar withthe advent of personal computers. This major technological breakthrough alsolaid the basis for the dominant approach to the scientific study of mind thatwas to crystalize in the next decade as the cognitivist paradigm. 

In fact, Warren McCulloch,more than any other figure, can serve as an exemplar of the hopes and thedebates of these formative years. As can be gleaned from his collected papersin Embodiments of Mind,[5](#5_7)McCulloch was a mysterious and paradoxical figure whose tone was often poeticand prophetic. His influence seemed to wane during the later years of his life,but his legacy is being reconsidered as cognitive science becomes more awarethat a thorough intertwining of the philosophical, the empirical, and themathematical, which McCulloch’s investigations exemplified, seems the best wayto continue working. His favorite description for his enterprise was“experimental epistemology”—an expression not favored by current usage. It isone of those remarkable simultaneities in the history of ideas that in the1940s the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget coined the expression “geneticepistemology” for his influential work, and the Austrian zoologist KonradLorenz started to speak of an “evolutionary epistemology.” 

There was, of course,considerably more to this creative decade. For instance, there was extensivedebate over whether logic is indeed sufficient to understand the brain’soperations, since logic neglects the brain’s distributed qualities. (Thisdebate continues today, and we will consider it in more detail later,especially as it relates to the question of “levels of explanation” in thestudy of cognition.) Alternative models and theories were put forth, which forthe most part were to lie dormant until they were revived in the 1970s as animportant alternative in cognitive science. 

By 1953 the main actorsof the cybernetics movement, in contrast to their initial unity and vitality,were distanced from each other, and many died shortly thereafter. It was mainlythe idea of mind as logical calculation that continued. 

## Defining the Cognitivist Hypothesis 

Just as 1943 was clearlythe year in which the cybernetics phase was born, so 1956 was clearly the yearthat gave birth to cognitivism. During this year, at two meetings held atCambridge and Dartmouth, new voices (such as those of Herbert Simon, NoamChomsky, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy) put forth ideas that were to becomethe major guidelines for modern cognitive science.[6](#6_7)

The central intuitionbehind cognitivism is that intelligence—human intelligence included—soresembles computation in its essential characteristics that cognition canactually be defined as computations of symbolic representations. Clearly thisorientation could not have emerged without the basis laid during the previousdecade. The main difference was that one of the many original, tentative ideaswas now promoted to a full-blown hypothesis, with a strong desire to set itsboundaries apart from its broader, exploratory, and interdisciplinary roots,where the social and biological sciences figured preeminently with all theirmultifarious complexity. 

What exactly does itmean to say that cognition can be defined as computation? As we mentioned inchapter 1, a computation is an operation that is carried out or performed onsymbols (on elements that represent what they stand for). The key notion hereis that of representation or “intentionality,” the philosopher’s term for aboutness. The cognitivist argument is that intelligentbehavior presupposes the ability to represent the world as being certain ways.We therefore cannot explain cognitive behavior unless we assume that an agentacts by representing relevant features of her situations. To the extent thather representation of a situation is accurate, the agent’s behavior will besuccessful (all other things being equal). 

This notion ofrepresentation is—at least since the demise of behaviorism—relatively uncontroversial.What is controversial is the next step, which is the cognitivist claim that theonly way we can account for intelligence and intentionality is to hypothesizethat cognition consists of acting on the basis of representations that arephysically realized in the form of a symbolic code in the brain or a machine. 

According to thecognitivist, the problem that must be solved is how to correlate the ascriptionof intentional or representational states (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.)with the physical changes that an agent undergoes in acting. In other words, ifwe wish to claim that intentional states have causal properties, we have toshow not only how those states are physically possible but how they can causebehavior. Here is where the notion of symbolic computationcomes in. Symbols are both physical and have semantic values. Computations areoperations on symbols that respect or are constrained by those semantic values.In other words, a computation is fundamentally semantic or representational—wecannot make sense of the idea of computation (as opposed to some random orarbitrary operation on symbols) without adverting to the semantic relationsamong the symbolic expressions. (This is the meaning of the popular slogan “nocomputation without representation.”) A digital computer, however, operatesonly on the physical form of the symbols it computes; it has no access to theirsemantic value. Its operations are nonetheless semantically constrained becauseevery semantic distinction relevant to its program has been encoded in the syntax of its symbolic language by the programmers. In acomputer, that is, syntax mirrors or is parallel to the (ascribed) semantics.The cognitivist claim, then, is that this parallelism shows us how intelligenceand intentionality (semantics) are physically and mechanically possible. Thusthe hypothesis is that computers provide a mechanical model of thought or, inother words, that thought consists of physical, symbolic computations.Cognitive science becomes the study of such cognitive, physical symbol systems.[7](#7_7) 

To understand this hypothesis properly, it is crucial to realize thelevel at which it is proposed. The cognitivist is not claiming that if we wereto open up someone’s head and look at the brain, we would find little symbolsbeing manipulated there. Although the symbolic level is physically realized, itis not reducible to the physical level. This point is intuitively obvious whenwe remember that the same symbol can be realized in numerous physical forms.Because of this nonreducibility it is quite possible that what corresponds tosome symbolic expression at the physical level is a global, highly distributedpattern of brain activity. We will return to consider this idea later. For nowthe point to be emphasized is that in addition to the levels of physics andneurobiology, cognitivism postulates a distinct, irreducible symbolic level inthe explanation of cognition. Furthermore, since symbols are semantic items,cognitivists also postulate a third distinctly semantic or representationallevel. (The irreducibility of this level too is intuitively obvious when weremember that the same semantic value can be realized in numerous symbolicforms.)[8](#8_6) 

This multilevelconception of scientific explanation is quite recent and is one of the majorinnovations of cognitive science. The roots and initial formulation of theinnovation as a broad scientific idea can be traced back to the era ofcybernetics, but cognitivists have contributed greatly to its further rigorousphilosophical articulation.[9](#9_7) We would like the reader to keepthis idea in mind, for it will take on added significance when we turn todiscuss the related—though still controversial—notion of emergence.

The reader should alsonotice that the cognitivist hypothesis entails a very strong claim about therelations between syntax and semantics. As we mentioned, in a computer programthe syntax of the symbolic code mirrors or encodes its semantics. In the caseof human language, it is far from obvious that all of the semantic distinctionsrelevant in an explanation of behavior can be mirrored syntactically. Indeed,many philosophical arguments can be given against this idea.[10](#10_7)Furthermore, although we know where the semantic level of a computer’scomputations comes from (the programmers), we have no idea how the symbolicexpressions supposed by the cognitivist to be encoded in the brain would gettheir meaning. 

Since our concern inthis book is with experience and cognition in its basic, perceptual modality,we will not take up such issues about language in detail here. Nonetheless,they are worth pointing out, since they are problems that lie at the heart ofthe cognitivist endeavor. 

The cognitivist researchprogram can be summarized, then, as answers to the following fundamentalquestions: 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

Information processing as symbolic computation—rule-based manipulationof symbols. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through any device that can support and manipulate discrete functionalelements—the symbols. The system interacts only with the form of the symbols(their physical attributes), not their meaning. 

 

[Question 3: ]()

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

Answer: 

When the symbols appropriately represent some aspect of the real world,and the information processing leads to a successful solution of the problemgiven to the system. 

## Manifestationsof Cognitivism 

### Cognitivismin Artificial Intelligence 

The manifestations ofcognitivism are nowhere more visible than in artificial intelligence (AI),which is the literal construal of the cognitivist hypothesis. Over the yearsmany interesting theoretical advances and technological applications have beenmade within this orientation, such as expert systems, robotics, and imageprocessing. These results have been widely publicized, and so we need notdigress to provide specific examples here. 

Because of widerimplications, however, it is worth noting that AI and its cognitivist basisreached a dramatic climax in Japan’s ICOT Fifth Generation Program. For thefirst time since the war there is a national plan involving the efforts ofindustry, government, and universities, launched in 1981. The core of thisprogram is a cognitive device capable of understanding human language and ofwriting its own programs when presented with a task by an untrained user. Notsurprisingly, the heart of the ICOT program was the development of a series ofinterfaces of knowledge representation and problem solving based on PROLOG, ahigh-level programming language for predicate logic. The ICOT program hastriggered immediate responses from Europe and the United States, and there islittle question that this is a major commercial concern and engineeringbattlefield. (It is also worth noting that the Japanese government has launchedin 1990 the Sixth Generation Program based on connectionist models.) Althoughit is only one example, the ICOT program is a major illustration of theinseparability of science and technology in the study of cognition and of theeffects that this marriage has on the public at large. 

The cognitivisthypothesis has in AI its most literal construal. The complementary endeavor isthe study of natural, biologically implemented cognitive systems, especiallyhumans. Here, too, computationally characterizable representations have beenthe main explanatory tool. Mental representations are taken to be occurrences ofa formal system, and the mind’s activity is what gives these representationstheir attitudinal color—beliefs, desires, intentions, etc. Here, therefore,unlike AI, we find an interest in what the natural cognitive systems are reallylike, and it is assumed that their cognitive representations are about something for the system;they are said to be intentional in the sense indicated here. 

### Cognitivism and the Brain 

Another equallyimportant effect of cognitivism is the way it has shaped current views aboutthe brain. Even though in theory the symbolic level of cognitivism iscompatible with many views about the brain, in practice almost all ofneurobiology (and its huge body of empirical evidence) has become permeatedwith the cognitivist, information-processing perspective. More often than not,the origins and assumptions of this perspective are not even questioned.[11](#11_4) 

The exemplar of thisapproach is the celebrated studies of the visual cortex, an area of the brainwhere one can easily detect electrical responses from neurons when the animalis presented with a visual image. It was reported early on that it was possibleto classify cortical neurons, such as feature detectors, responding to certainattributes of the object being presented—its orientation, contrast, velocity,color, and so on. In line with the cognitivist hypothesis, these results havebeen seen as the biological basis for the notion that the brain picks up visualinformation from the retina through the feature-specific neurons in the cortex,and the information is then passed on to later stages in the brain for furtherprocessing (conceptual categorization, memory associations, and eventuallyaction).[12](#12_3) 

In its most extremeform, this view of the brain is expressed in Barlow’s “grandmother cell”doctrine, where there is a correspondence between concepts (such as the conceptsomeone has of her grandmother) or percepts and specific neurons.[13](#13_3)(This is equivalent to Al detectors and labeled lines.) This extreme view iswaning in popularity now,[14](#14_3) but the basic idea that the brainis an information-processing device that responds selectively to features ofthe environment remains as the dominant core of modern neuroscience and in thepublic’s understanding. 

### Cognitivismin Psychology 

Psychology is thediscipline that most people assume to be the study of mind. Psychology predatescognitive science and cognitivism and is not coextensive with either of them.What influence has cognitivism had on psychology? To understand something ofthis, we need some historical background in psychology. 

We have alreadymentioned introspectionism and its differences from mindfulness meditation. Itmay be that when anyone first thinks to inquire about the mind, there are alimited number of possibilities of how to proceed, and turning to one’s ownmind is one of the universal strategies that will occur. This track, developedby the meditative traditions of India, was aborted for psychology in the Westwhen the nineteenth-century introspectionists, lacking a method of mindfulness,tried to treat the mind as an external object, with disastrous results forinterobserver agreement. The breakdown of introspectionism intononcommensurable, warring laboratories left experimental psychology with aprofound distrust of self-knowledge as a legitimate procedure in psychology.Introspectionism was replaced by the dominant school of behaviorism. 

One obvious alternativeto looking inward to the mind is to look outward at behavior; we even have thefolk saying, “Actions speak louder than words.” Behaviorism was particularlycompatible with the early twentieth-century positivist zeitgeist of disembodiedobjectivism in science, for it eliminated mind entirely from its psychology.According to behaviorism, although one could objectively observe inputs to theorganism (stimuli) and outputs (behavior) and could investigate the lawfulrelationships between inputs and outputs over time, the organism itself (bothits mind and its biological body) was a black box that was methodologicallyunapproachable by behavioral science (hence no rules, no symbols, nocomputations). Behaviorism completely dominated North American experimentalpsychology from the 1920s until fairly recently. 

The first signs of a postbehaviorist experimental cognitive psychologybegan to appear in the late 1950s. The trick of these early researchers whowere still, strictly speaking, positivist, was to find experimental means fordefining and measuring the effect of a given forbidden mentalistic phenomenon.Let us take mental images as an example. 

A mental image isundisputably in the black box for a behaviorist; it is not publicly observable,so one cannot have observer agreement about it. Researchers, however, graduallydevised demonstrations of the pragmatic effects of mental images. Instructingan experimental subject to hold a mental image during a signal detection tasklowers the accuracy of the detection, and, furthermore, this effect is modalityspecific (a visual image interferes more in a visual detection task than anauditory task, and vice versa).[15](#15_3) Such experiments legitimateimagery even in behaviorist terminology—imagery is a powerful interveningvariable. Furthermore, experiments began to explore the behavior of mentalimages in themselves, often showing that they had properties like those ofperceptual images. In delightfully ingenious experiments, Kosslyn showed thatmental visual images appear to be scanned in real time,[16](#16_3)and Shepard and Metzler showed that mental images appear to be rotated in realtime just as perceptual visual images are.[17](#17_3)Studies of other formerly mentalistic (now called cognitive) phenomena began tobe performed in perception, memory, language, problem solving, concepts, anddecision making. 

What influence didcognitivism have on this emerging experimental investigation of the mind?Interestingly, the initial effect of cognitivism on psychology was extremelyliberating. The computer metaphor of the mind could be used to formulateexperimental hypotheses or even to legitimate one’s theory simply byprogramming it. Although the programs were almost entirely cognitivist(psychological processes were modeled in terms of explicit rules, symbols, andrepresentations), the overall effect was to breach the constraints ofbehaviorist orthodoxy and admit into psychology long-suppressed, commonsenseunderstanding of the mind. For example, developmental psycholinguistics could nowexplore openly the idea that children learn the vocabulary and grammar of theirlanguage not as reinforced, paired associates but as hypotheses about correctadult speech that develop with their cognitive capacities and experience.[18](#18_3) Motivation could be understood asmore than hours of deprivation; one could now talk of cognitive representationsof goals and plans.[19](#19_3) The social system was not just a complexstimulus; it could be modeled in the mind as representations of scripts andsocial schemas.[20](#20_3) One could speak of the humaninformation processor as a lay scientist, testing hypotheses and makingmistakes.[21](#21_3) In short, the introduction of thecomputer metaphor in a very general, albeit implicitly cognitivist, sense intocognitive psychology allowed an explosion of commonsense theory and its operationalizationinto computer models and human research. 

Strict cognitivism inits explicit form, on the other hand, places strong constraints on theory andhas generated primarily philosophical debate. Let us return to mental imageryas an example. In cognitivism, mental imagery, like any other cognitivephenomenon, can be no more than the manipulation of symbols by computationalrules. Yet Shepard’s and Kosslyn’s experiments have demonstrated that mentalimages perform in a continuous fashion in real time, very like visualperception. Does this refute cognitivism? A hard-line cognitivist, such asPylyshyn, argues that images are simply subjective epiphenomena (as they werefor behaviorism) of more fundamental symbolic computations.[22](#22_3)Attempting to bridge the rift between data and cognitivist theory, Kosslyn hasformulated a model by which images are generated in the mind by the same rulesthat generate images in computer displays: the interaction of languagelikeoperations and picturelike operations together generate the internal eye.[23](#23_3) One current view of the imagerydebate is that since, at best, the imagery research demonstrates the similarityof imagery to perception, this simply points us to the need for a viableaccount of perception.[24](#24_1) 

### Cognitivism and Psychoanalysis 

We stated earlier thatpsychoanalytic theory had mirrored much of the development of cognitivescience. In fact, psychoanalysis was explicitly cognitivist in its inception.[25](#25_1) Freud attended Brentano’s coursein Vienna, as did Husserl, and he fully endorsed the representational andintentional view of the mind. For Freud, nothing could affect behavior unlessit were mediated by a representation, even an instinct. “An instinct can neverbe an object of consciousness—only the idea that represents the instinct. Evenin the unconscious, moreover, it can only be represented by the idea.”[26](#26_1) Within this framework, Freud’sgreat discovery was that not all representations were accessible toconsciousness; he never seemed to doubt that the unconscious, for all that itmight operate on a different symbol system than the conscious, was fullysymbolic, fully intentional, and fully representational. 

Freud’s descriptions ofmental structures and processes are sufficiently general and metaphorical thatthey have proved translatable (with arguable degrees of loss of meaning) intothe language of other psychological systems. In the Anglo-American world, oneextreme was Dollard and Miller’s hotly contested retheorizing of Freudiandiscoveries in terms of behaviorist-based learning theory.[27](#27_1)More relevant for us was Erdelyi’s rather placidly accepted (perhaps because ofFreud’s preexisting cognitivist “metaphysics”) translation intocognitivist-based information-processing language.[28](#28_1)For example, Freud’s concept of repression/censorship becomes, in cognitivistterms, the matching of information from a perception or idea to a criterionlevel for acceptable accounts of anxiety: if it is above the criterion, it goesto a stop-processing/accessing information box, from whence it is shunted backto the unconscious; if below the criterion, it is allowed into the preconsciousand, perhaps, then into the conscious. After another criterion match in thedecision tree, it is either allowed into behavior or suppressed. Does such adescription add anything to Freud? It certainly serves to translate suchnotions as the Freudian unconscious into what is taken to be a “scientific”currency of the day. It is also fair to say that many contemporary post-Freudiantheorists in Europe—such as Jacques Lacan—would disagree: such theorizingmisses the central spirit of the psychoanalytic journey—to move beyond the trapof representations, including those about the unconscious. 

It is presentlyfashionable to say that Freud “decentered” the self; what he actually did wasto divide the self into several basic selves. Freud was not a strictcognitivist in the Pylyshyn sense: the unconscious had the same type ofrepresentations as the conscious, all of which could, at least theoretically,become, or have been, conscious. Modern strict cognitivism has a far moreradical and alienating view of unconscious processing. It is to this issue thatwe now turn as we discuss the meaning of cognitivism for our experience. 

## Cognitivismand Human Experience 

What implications doesthis cognitivist research program have for an understanding of our experience?We wish to emphasize two related points: (1) cognitivism postulates mental orcognitive processes of which we are not only unaware but of which we cannot beaware, and (2) cognitivism is thereby led to embrace the idea that the self orcognizing subject is fundamentally fragmented or nonunified. These two pointswill become considerably intertwined as we proceed. 

As the reader mightrecall, our first point has already appeared when we presented the tensionbetween science and experience to which cognitive science gives rise. There wequoted Daniel Dennett’s claim that all cognitivist theories are theories ofwhat Dennett calls the “sub-personal level.” By this phrase, Dennett means thatcognitivism postulates mental (not just physical and biological) mechanisms and processes that are not accessible to the“personal level” of consciousness, especially self-consciousness. In other words,one cannot discern in conscious awareness or self-conscious introspection anyof the cognitive structures and processes that are postulated to account forcognitive behavior. Indeed, if cognition is fundamentally symbolic computation,this discrepancy between personal and subpersonal immediately follows, sincepresumably none of us has any awareness of computing in an internal, symbolicmedium when we think. 

It is possible tooverlook the depth of this challenge to our self-understanding, largely becauseof our post-Freudian belief in the unconscious. There is a difference, however,between what we usually mean by “unconscious” and the sense in which mentalprocesses are said to be unconscious in cognitivism: we usually suppose thatwhat is unconscious can be brought to consciousness—if not throughself-conscious reflection, then through a disciplined procedure such aspsychoanalysis. Cognitivism, on the other hand, postulates processes that aremental but that cannot be brought to consciousness at all. Thus we are notsimply unaware of the rules that govern the generation of mental images or ofthe rules that govern visual processing; we could not be aware of these rules.Indeed, it is typically noted that if such cognitive processes could be madeconscious, then they could not be fast and automatic and so could not functionproperly. In one formulation these cognitive processes are even considered tobe “modular” (to comprise distinct subsystems that cannot be penetrated byconscious mental activity).[29](#29_1) Thus cognitivism challenges ourconviction that consciousness and the mind either amount to the same thing orthere is an essential or necessary connection between them. 

Of course, Freud toochallenged the idea that the mind and consciousness are the same. Furthermore,he certainly realized that to distinguish between the mind and consciousnessentails the disunity of the self or cognizing subject, a point to which weshall turn shortly. It is not clear, however, whether Freud took the furtherstep of calling into question the idea that there is an essential or necessaryconnection between the mind and consciousness. As Dennett notes, Freud, in hisargument for unconscious beliefs, desires, and motivations, left open thepossibility that these unconscious processes belonged to a fragment ofourselves hidden in the depths of the psyche.[30](#30_1)Although it is not clear the extent to which Freud meant such a fragmentationliterally, it is clear that cognitive science does take a literal, if nothomuncular, view. As Dennett puts it, “Although the new [cognitivist] theoriesabound with deliberately fanciful homunculus metaphors—subsystems like littlepeople in the brain sending messages back and forth, asking for help, obeyingand volunteering—the actual subsystems are deemed to be unproblematic nonconscious bits of organic machinery, as utterly lackingin point of view or inner life as a kidney or kneecap.”[31](#31_1)In other words, the characterization of these “sub-personal” systems in“fanciful homunculus metaphors” is only provisional, for eventually all suchmetaphors are “discharged”—they are traded in for the storm of activity amongsuch selfless processes as neural networks or AI data structures.[32](#32_1)

Our pretheoretical,everyday conviction, however, is that cognition and consciousness—especiallyself-consciousness—belong together in the same domain. Cognitivism runsdirectly counter to this conviction: in determining the domain of cognition, itexplicitly cuts across the conscious/unconscious distinction. The domain ofcognition consists of those systems that must be seen as having a distinctrepresentational level, not necessarily of those systems that are conscious.Some representational systems are, of course, conscious, but they need not beto have representations or intentional states. Thus for cognitivists, cognitionand intention­ality (representation) are the inseparable pair, not cognitionand consciousness. 

This theoreticaldivision of the domain of cognition is considered by cognitivists to be “anempirical discovery of no small importance”[33](#33_1)and indicates, again, the remarkable mutation wrought by cognitivism. But now aproblem arises: we seem to be losing our grip on something that is undeniablyclose and familiar—our sense of self. If consciousness—to say nothing ofself-consciousness—is not essential for cognition, and if, in the case ofcognitive systems that are conscious, such as ourselves, consciousnessamounts to only one kind of mental process, then just what is the cognizingsubject? Is it the collection of all mental processes, both conscious andunconscious? Or is it simply one kind of mental process, such as consciousness,among all the others? In either case, our sense of self is challenged, for wetypically suppose that to be a self is to have a coherent and unified “point ofview,” a stable and constant vantage point from which to think, perceive, andact. Indeed, this sense that we have (are?) a self seems so incontrovertiblethat its calling into question or denial—even by science—strikes us as absurd.And yet, if someone were to turn the tables and ask us to look for the self, wewould be hard pressed to find it. Dennett, as usual, makes this point withflair: “You enter the brain through the eye, march up the optic nerve, roundand round the cortex, looking behind every neuron, and then before you know it,you emerge into daylight on the spike of a motor nerve impulse, scratching yourhead and wondering where the self is.”[34](#34_1)

Our problem, however,goes even deeper. It is one thing to be unable to find a coherent and unifiedself amid the furious storm of subpersonal activity. This inability wouldcertainly challenge our sense of self, but the challenge would be limited. Wecould still suppose that there really is a self but that we simply cannot findit in this fashion. Perhaps, as Jean-Paul Sartre held, the self is too close,and so we cannot uncover it by turning back upon ourselves. The cognitivistchallenge, however, is much more serious. According to cognitivism, cognitioncan proceed without consciousness, for there is no essential or necessaryconnection between them. Now whatever else we suppose the self to be, wetypically suppose that consciousness is its central feature. It follows, then,that cognitivism challenges our conviction that the most central feature of theself is needed for cognition. In other words, the cognitivist challenge doesnot consist simply in asserting that we cannot find the self; it consists,rather, in the further implication that the self is not even needed forcognition. 

At this point, thetension between science and experience should be obvious and tangible. Ifcognition can proceed without the self, then why do we nonetheless have theexperience of self? We cannot simply dismiss this experience withoutexplanation. 

Until recently, mostphilosophers nonchalantly shrugged off this problem by arguing that theperplexities surrounding it are just not relevant to the purposes of cognitivescience.[35](#35_1) This mood, however, has begun tochange. Indeed, one prominent cognitive scientist, Ray Jackendoff, has recentlypublished a book that attempts to address just these issues.[36](#36_1)Jackendoff’s work is important, for it squarely faces the problematic relationsamong consciousness, mind, and self uncovered by cognitivism. His work is alsoinstructive for our purposes, for it provides a paradigm of how the purelytheoretical treatment of the relation between science and experience is bothmethodologically and empirically incomplete. For these reasons, we willconclude this chapter with a brief consideration of Jackendoff’s project. 

## Experience and the Computational Mind 

We have now seen that,in the hands of cognitivism, the cognizing subject is split in two: cognitionconsists, on the one hand, of unconscious symbolic computation and, on theother hand, of conscious experience. Jackendoff’s work focuses on the problematicrelation between these two aspects of cognition, which he calls the computational mind and the phenomenologicalmind. 

It is important toappreciate just how problematic the relation between the computational mind andthe phenomenological mind is. The problem centers on how intentionality andconsciousness are related. We have seen that cognitivism draws a sharp andfundamental distinction between these two aspects of cognition. Our cognition,however, seems to be directed toward the world in a way that intimatelyinvolves consciousness. Thus notice that our cognition is directed toward theworld in a certain way: it is directed toward theworld as we experience it. For example, we perceivethe world to be three-dimensional, macroscopic, colored, etc.; we do notperceive it as composed of subatomic particles. Thus our cognition is directedtoward an experiential world, or in the terms of phenomenology, toward a lived world. How, then, if intentionality and consciousnessare fundamentally distinct, does cognition come to be about the world as weconsciously experience it? This problem is paramount, for as Jackendoff notes,by postulating a computational mind that is inaccessible to consciousness,cognitivism “offers no explication of what a conscious experience is” (p. 20). 

Jackendoff calls thisproblem the “mind-mind problem,” for it centers on the relation between thecomputational mind and the phenomenological mind. In his words (p. 20), 

The upshot is that psychology now has not two domains to worry about,the brain and mind, but three: the brain, the computational mind, and thephenomenological mind. Consequently, Descartes’ formulation of the mind-bodyproblem is split into two separate issues. The “phenomenological mind-bodyproblem” … is, How can a brain have experiences? The “computational mind-bodyproblem” is, How can a brain accomplish reasoning? In addition, we have themind-mind problem, namely, What is the relationshipbetween computational states and experience? 

It should be apparentfrom our presentation of cognitivism that the motivation for the cognitivisthypothesis has been what Jackendoff calls the “computational mind-bodyproblem,” that is, the problem of how thought construed as reasoning isphysically and mechanically possible. The “mind-mind problem,” on the otherhand, corresponds to the problem of intentionality and consciousness in itsfull-blown form: How is cognition as symbolic computation related to the worldas experienced? 

How, then, doesJackendoff propose to tackle this issue? His basic idea is that “the elementsof conscious awareness are caused by/supported by/projected from informationand processes of the computational mind” (p. 23). In other words, he proposesto consider conscious awareness “as an externalizationor projection of some subset of elements of thecomputational mind” (p. 23). The research program, then, is to determine whichelements “project” or “support” conscious awareness. Jackendoff argues thatthese elements correspond to intermediate-level representationsin the computational mind (to representations that lie midway between the most“peripheral” or sensory level and the most “central” or thoughtlike level). 

Jackendoff successivelyrefines this “intermediate-level theory” throughout the course of his book. Weshall return to one of these refinements after we have presented the enactiveview of cognition. At this point we wish simply to emphasize two importantconsequences that follow from his basic idea of consciousness as a projectionfrom intermediate levels of representation in the computational mind. The firstconsequence is that to develop his computational theory, Jackendoff requiresexperiential or phenomenological evidence. The second is that his theoryreveals the disunity of the cognizing subject. These two consequences bring tothe fore the necessity of complementing cognitive science with a pragmatic,mindful, open-ended approach to human experience, such as we find in themindfulness/awareness tradition. 

Consider first thataccording to Jackendoff’s theory the organization of conscious awareness isdetermined by the computational mind. As Jackendoff puts it, “Everyphenomenological distinction is caused by/supported by/projected from acorresponding computational distinction” (p. 24). It follows, then, thatphenomenological distinctions constrain computational models. In other words,any computational model of the mind that purports to explain thephenomenological mind must have the resources to explain all of thedistinctions that we make in conscious experience. Jackendoff is well aware ofthis consequence, for he writes, “The empirical force of this hypothesis is tobring phenomenological evidence to bear on thecomputational theory. The computational theory must be sufficiently expressive(must contain sufficient distinctions of the proper sorts) to make the world ofawareness possible. Thus, if there is a phenomenological distinction that isnot yet expressed by our current computational theory, the theory must beenriched or revised” (p. 25). 

In this paragraph, wesee again how the fundamental circularity with which we began this book comesto the fore. To explain cognition, we turn to investigate ourstructure—understood in the present context as our computational mind. Butsince it is also cognition as experience that we wish to explain, we must turnback and attend to the kinds of distinctions we draw in experience—thephenomenological mind. Having attended to experience in this way, we can thenturn back to enrich and revise our computational theory, and so on. Our pointis not at all that this circle is vicious. Rather, our point is that we cannotsituate ourselves properly within this circle without a disciplined andopen-ended approach from the side of experience. 

To appreciate this point,let us ask, How are we to specify the appropriate phenomenological orexperiential distinctions? Are these distinctions simply given to us by virtueof our being experiencing creatures? Jackendoff appears to think so, foralthough he admits that experiential evidence constrains his theory, henonetheless treats experience as something that requires no disciplinedprocedure for its investigation beyond “the hope that disagreements aboutphenomenology can be settled in an atmosphere of mutual trust” (p. 275). Thisis quite an assumption for a field that saw the demise of introspectionismbecause of its total inability to agree on anything and that can readily seepeople and nations disagreeing constantly over the nature of even simplematters of experience. Jackendoff assumes that everyday—largelymindless—experience provides access to all the relevant phenomenologicalevidence and that the phenomenological quest is limited to just that largelymindless state. He considers neither the possibility that conscious awarenesscan be progressively developed beyond its everyday form (a strange omissionconsidering his interest in musical cognition) nor that such development can beused to provide direct insight into the structure and constitution ofexperience. These are assumptions that Jackendoff is forced to make because ourWestern tradition neither provides a critique of mindless phenomenologizing norprovides any method, other than hit or miss hand waving, to investigate thephenomenological mind. We find this all the more telling because Jackendoffdemonstrates such phenomenological acumen and brilliant synergistic theorizing.There is clearly the need for the disciplined, open-ended approach toexperience if such matters are to be discussed. 

The relevance of amindful, open-ended stance toward experience again becomes apparent when weconsider our second point, which is that Jackendoff’s theory implies thedisunity of the cognizing subject. We typically suppose that consciousnessunifies and grounds all the disparate elements of one’s self—one’s thoughts,feelings, perceptions, etc. The phrase “unity of consciousness” refers to theidea that one understands all of one’s experiences as happening to a singleself. As Jackendoff rightly notes, however, there is an equally obvious disunity in consciousness, for the forms in which we can beconsciously aware depend considerably on the modalities of experience. Thusvisual conscious awareness is markedly distinct from auditory awareness, andboth are markedly distinct from tactile awareness. Since, as we have just seen,Jackendoff’s computational theory is constrained by phenomenologicaldistinctions, he must give some account of this experiential disunity.Jackendoff suggests that each form of conscious awareness is derived orprojected from a different set of representational structures in thecomputational mind (p. 52): 

[The hypothesis thatemerges from these considerations is that each modality of awareness comes froma different level or set of levels of representation. The disunity of awarenessthus arises from the fact that each of the relevant levels involves its ownspecial repertoire of distinctions. … ]()

[This theory] goes against the grain of the prevailing approaches toconsciousness, which start with the premise that consciousness is unified andthen try to locate a unique source for it. [This theory] claims thatconsciousness is fundamentally not unified and that one should seek multiplesources. 

In the previous section,we saw that cognitivism implies the disunity of the cognizing subject becauseit draws a fundamental distinction between consciousness and intentionality.Jackendoff takes this disunity one step further, however, by claiming thatconsciousness itself is fundamentally disunified. Furthermore, his view ismotivated not by the problem of how cognition is physically possible (the“computational mind-body problem”) but rather by the problem of how thecomputational mind generates conscious experience (the “mind-mind” problem).For this reason Jackendoff does not simply assert the disunity of the cognizingsubject on computational grounds; he also respects and attends to thephenomenological evidence for disunity. Indeed, it is precisely this disunitythat Jackendoff uses to build a bridge between the computational mind and thephenomenological mind (p. 51). 

This considerableadvance, however, makes the tension between science and experience only moreapparent. It must be remembered that Jackendoff attends to conscious experiencebecause he holds that it results from an underlying computational organization.Thus for Jackendoff the distinctions present in the phenomenological mind arenot made by the phenomenological mind; they are,rather, projected into the phenomenological mind by the computational mind.Indeed, Jackendoff explicitly rejects the idea that consciousness has anycausal efficacy; instead he holds that all causality takes place at thecomputational level. He is thus led to embrace a consequence that he himselfadmits to be unpleasant: if consciousness has no causal efficacy, then it canhave no effects and so “is not good for anything” (p. 26). 

With this consequence weare confronted in a more extreme form with the effects of the cognitivistseparation of intentionality and consciousness. If cognition can proceedwithout consciousness, if consciousness itself is “not good for anything,” thenwhy are we consciously aware, both of ourselves and of the world? Doescognitive science require that we treat experience as, in the end, simplyepiphenomenal? 

Some cognitivescientists appear to be willing to embrace just this conclusion. They shrugtheir shoulders and say, “So much the worse for experience,” as if experiencecould be blamed for not living up to the demands of a theory. And yet what doessuch a conclusion mean to these very same scientists and philosophers, when notengaged in theoretical reflection? Does it change in any way the flow of livedexperience? Is the philosophical conclusion itself, as we fear it is in mostmodern philosophy, an epiphenomenon? 

We have already arguedthat these two responses—the dismissal of experience on the one hand and theunquestioned acceptance of it on the other—are extreme and lead to an impasse.In so arguing, we obviously imply the possibility of some other, middle way.The next several chapters are devoted to the exploration of such a middle wayand have the experience of self as their theme. In the next chapter we turn toface directly the “I of the storm” in a reflection on selfless minds and humanexperience. As we will see, the disunity of the self and of consciousawareness, which modern-day cognitivism has uncovered, is in fact a focal pointof the entire mindfulness/awareness tradition.

# [4 ]()The I of the Storm 

## WhatDo We Mean by “Self”? 

At every moment of ourlives there is something going on, some experience. We see, hear, smell, taste,touch, think. We can be pleased, angry, afraid, tired, perplexed, interested,agonizingly self-conscious, or absorbed in a pursuit. I can feel that I am being overwhelmed by my ownemotions, that I have greater worth when praised by another, that I amdestroyed by a loss. What is this self, this ego-center, that appears anddisappears, that seems so constant yet so fragile, so familiar and yet soelusive? 

We are caught in acontradiction. On the one hand, even a cursory attention to experience shows usthat our experience is always changing and, furthermore, is always dependent ona particular situation. To be human, indeed to be living, is always to be in asituation, a context, a world. We have no experience of anything that ispermanent and independent of these situations. Yet most of us are convinced ofour identities: we have a personality, memories and recollections, and plansand anticipations, which seem to come together in a coherent point of view, acenter from which we survey the world, the ground on which we stand. How couldsuch a point of view be possible if it were not rooted in a single,independent, truly existing self or ego? 

This question is themeeting ground of everything in this book: cognitive science, philosophy, andthe meditative tradition of mindfulness/awareness. We wish to make a sweepingclaim: all of the reflective traditions in human history—philosophy, science,psychoanalysis, religion, meditation—have challenged the naive sense of self.No tradition has ever claimed to discover an independent, fixed, or unitaryself within the world of experience. Let us give the voice for this to DavidHume’s famous passage: “For my part, when I enter most intimately into whatI call myself, I always stumble on some particularperception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain orpleasure. I never can catch myself at any timewithout a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception.”[1](#1_9) Such an insight directlycontradicts our ongoing sense of self. 

It is thiscontradiction, the incommensurability of the outcome of reflection andexperience, that has provoked us on the journey in this book. We believe thatmany non-Western (even contemplative) traditions, and all Western traditions,deal with this contradiction simply by turning away from it, refusing toconfront it, a withdrawal that can take one of two forms. The usual way issimply to ignore it. Hume, for example, unable to find the self as he reflectedin his study, chose to withdraw and immerse himself in a game of backgammon; heresigned himself to the separation of life and reflection. Jean-Paul Sartreexpresses this by saying that we are “condemned” to a belief in the self. Thesecond tactic is to postulate a transcendental self that can never be known toexperience, such as the atman of the Upanishads orthe transcendental ego of Kant.[2](#2_9) (Noncontemplative traditions, ofcourse, can just not notice the contradiction—for example, self-concept theoryin psychology.)[3](#3_9) The major—and perhapsonly—tradition that we know that directly confronts this contradiction and thathas spoken to it for a long time arose from the practice ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. 

We have already described mindfulness/awareness practice as a gradualdevelopment of the ability to be present with one’s mind and body not only informal meditation but in the experiences of everyday life. Beginning meditatorsare usually amazed at the tumultuous activity of their mind as perceptions,thoughts, feelings, desires, fears, and every other kind of mental contentpursue each other endlessly like a cat chasing its tail. As the meditatorsdevelop some stability of mindfulness/awareness so that they have periods whenthey are not constantly (to use traditional images) sucked into the whirlpoolor thrown from a horse, they begin to have insight into what the mind, as it isexperienced, is really like. Experiences, they notice, are impermanent. This isnot just the leaves-fall, maidens-wither, and kings-are-forgotten type ofimpermance (traditionally called gross impermance) with which all people arehauntingly familiar but a personal penetrating impermanence of the activity ofthe mind itself. Moment by moment new experiences happen and are gone. It is arapidly shifting stream of momentary mental occurrences. Furthermore, the shiftinessincludes the perceiver as much as the perceptions. There is no experiencer,just as Hume noticed, who remains constant to receive experiences, no landingplatform for experience. This actual experiential sense of no one home iscalled selflessness or egolessness.Moment by moment the meditator also sees the mind pulling away from its senseof impermance and lack of self, sees it grasping experiences as though theywere permanent, commenting on experiences as though there were a constantperceiver to comment, seeking any mental entertainment that will disruptmindfulness, and restlessly fleeing to the next preoccupation, all with a senseof constant struggle. This undercurrent of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, andunsatisfactoriness that pervades experience is called Dukkha,usually translated as suffering. Suffering arises quite naturally and thengrows as the mind seeks to avoid its natural grounding in impermanence and lackof self. 

The tension between theongoing sense of self in ordinary experience and the failure to find that selfin reflection is of central importance in Buddhism—the origin of humansuffering is just this tendency to grasp onto and build a sense of self, anego, where there is none. As meditators catch glimpses of impermanence,selflessness, and suffering (known as the three marks of existence) and someinkling that the pervasiveness of suffering (known as the First Noble Truth)may have its origin in their own self-grasping (known as the Second NobleTruth), they may develop some real motivation and urgency to persevere in theirinvestigation of mind. They try to develop a strong and stable insight andinquisitiveness into the moment to moment arising of mind. They are encouragedto investigate: How does this moment arise? What areits conditions? What is the nature of “my” reactivity to it? Where does theexperience of “I” occur? 

The search for how theself arises is thus a way of asking, “What and where is mind?” in a direct andpersonal way. The initial spirit of inquisitiveness in these questions isactually not unlike Descartes’s Meditations, thoughthis statement might surprise some people since Descartes has received such badpress these days. Descartes’s initial decision to rely not on the word of theChurch fathers but rather on what his own mind could discern in reflectionobviously partakes of the spirit of self-reliant investigation, as doesphenomenology. Descartes, however, stopped short: His famous “I think, I am”simply leaves untouched the nature of the “I” that thinks. True, Descartes didinfer that the “I” is fundamentally a thinking thing, but here he went too far:the only certainty that “I am” carries is that of being a thought. If Descarteshad been fully rigorous, mindful, and attentive, he would not have jumped tothe conclusion that I am a thinking thing (rescogitans); rather he would have kept his attention on the very process of mind itself. 

In mindfulness/awarenesspractice, the awareness of thinking, emotions, and bodily sensations becomesquite pronounced in the basic restlessness that we normally experience. Topenetrate that experience, to discern what it is and how it arises, some typesof mindfulness meditation direct the meditator to attend to experience asprecisely and dispassionately as possible. It is only through a pragmatic,open-ended reflection that we can examine systematically and directly thisrestlessness that we usually ignore. As the contents of experiencearise—discursive thoughts, emotional tonalities, bodily sensations—the meditatoris attentive not by becoming concerned with the contents of the thoughts or with the sense of Ithinking but rather by simply noting “thinking” and directing his attention tothe never-ceasing process of that experience. 

Just as the mindfulnessmeditator is amazed to discover how mindless he is in daily life, so the firstinsights of the meditator who begins to question the self are normally notegolessness but the discovery of total egomania. Constantly one thinks, feels,and acts as though one had a self to protect and preserve. The slightestencroachment on the self’s territory (a splinter in the finger, a noisyneighbor) arouses fear and anger. The slightest hope of self-enhancement (gain,praise, fame, pleasure) arouses greed and grasping. Any hint that a situationis irrelevant to the self (waiting for a bus, meditating) arouses boredom. Suchimpulses are instinctual, automatic, pervasive, and powerful. They arecompletely taken for granted in daily life. The impulses are certainly there,constantly occurring, yet in the light of the questioning meditator, do theymake any sense? What kind of self does he think he has to warrant suchattitudes? 

The Tibetan teacherTsultrim Gyamtso puts the dilemma this way: 

To have any meaning such a self has to be lasting, for if it perishedevery moment one would not be so concerned about what was going to happen to itthe next moment; it would not be one’s “self” anymore. Again it has to besingle. If one had no separate identity why should one worry about whathappened to one’s “self” any more than one worried about anyone else’s? It hasto be independent or there would be no sense in saying “I did this” or “I havethat.” If one had no independent existence there would be no-one to claim theactions and experiences as its own … We all act as if we had lasting, separate,and independent selves that it is our constant preoccupation to protect andfoster. It is an unthinking habit that most of us would normally be mostunlikely to question or explain. However, all our suffering is associated withthis pre-occupation. All loss and gain, pleasure and pain arise because weidentify so closely with this vague feeling of selfness that we have. We are soemotionally involved with and attached to this “self ” that we take it forgranted. … The meditator does not speculate about this “self.” He does not havetheories about whether it does or does not exist. Instead he just trainshimself to watch … how his mind clings to the idea of self and “mine” and howall his sufferings arise from this attachment. At the same time he lookscarefully for that self. He tries to isolate it from all his other experiences.Since it is the culprit as far as all his suffering is concerned, he wants tofind it and identify it. The irony is that however much he tries, he does notfind anything that corresponds to the self.[4](#4_9)

If there is noexperienced self, then how is it that we think there is? What is the origin ofour self-serving habits? What is it in experience that we take for a self? 

## Looking for a Self in the Aggregates 

We now turn to some ofthe categories in the Buddhist teachings called the Abhidharma.[5](#5_9) This term refers to a collectionof texts that forms one of the three divisions of the Buddhist canon (the othertwo are the Vinaya, which contains ethical precepts,and the Sutras, which contain the speeches of theBuddha). Based on the Abhidharma texts and their later commentaries, thereemerged a tradition of analytic investigation of the nature of experience,which is still taught and used in contemplation by most Buddhist schools. TheAbhidharma contains various sets of categories for examining the arising of thesense of self. These are not intended as ontological categories, such as onefinds, for example, in Aristotle’s Metaphysics.Rather, these categories serve on the one hand as simple descriptions ofexperience and on the other hand as pointers toward investigation.[6](#6_9)

The most popular set of these categories, one that is common to allBuddhist schools, is known as the five aggregates. (The Sanscrit termtranslated as “aggregate” is skandha, which literallymeans “heap.” The story goes that when the Buddha first taught this frameworkfor examining experience, he used piles of grain to stand for each aggregate.)The five aggregates are 

1.   Forms 

2.  Feelings/sensations 

3.  Perceptions(discernments)/impulses 

4.  Dispositional formations 

5.  Consciousnesses[7](#7_9)

The first of the fiveaggregates is considered to be based on the physical or material; the remainingfour are mental. All five together constitute the psychophysical complex thatmakes up a person and that makes up each moment of experience.[8](#8_8)We will examine the way in which we take each of these to be ourselves and willquery whether we can find something in the aggregates that will answer to ourbasic, emotional, reactional conviction in the reality of self. In other words,we will be looking for a full-blown, really existing ego-self—some lasting selfthat would serve as the object of our emotional conviction that there really isa ground underneath the dependent, impermanent, everyday personality. 

### Forms

This category refers tothe body and the physical environment. It does so, however, strictly in termsof the senses—the six sense organs and the corresponding objects of thoseorgans.[9](#9_9) They are the eye and visibleobjects, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, thebody and touchables, and the mind and thoughts. The sense organs do not referto the gross external organ but to the actual physical mechanism of perception.The mind organ (there is debate in the tradition as to just what physicalstructure that is) and thoughts are treated as a sense and its object becausethat is how they appear in experience: we feel that we perceive our thoughtswith our mind just as we perceive a visible object with our eye. 

We might point out thateven at this level of analysis we have already departed from the usual idea ofan abstract, disembodied observer who, like a cognitive entity parachuted intoa ready-made world, encounters matter as a separate and independent category.Here, as in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, our encounter with the physical isalready situated and embodied. Matter is described experientially. 

Is our body our self?Think how important our body and possessions are to us, how terrified we becomeif the body or important possessions are threatened, how angry or depressed webecome if they are damaged. Think of how much effort, money, and emotion wespend on feeding, grooming, and caring for the body. Emotionally we treat thebody as though it were ourself. Intellectually we may do so also. Ourcircumstances and moods may change, but the body appears stable. The body isthe location point of the senses; we look at the world from the vantage pointof the body, and we perceive the objects of our senses to be related spatiallyto our body. Though the mind may wander, sleeping or daydreaming, we count onreturning to the same body. 

Yet do we really thinkof the body as the same as the self? As upset as we might be at the loss of afinger (or any other body part), we would not feel that we had thereby lost ouridentity. In fact, even in normal circumstances, the entire makeup of the bodychanges rapidly, as seen by the turnover of one’s cells. Let us take a briefphilosophical excursion on this point. 

We might ask, “What do the cells that make up my body now have incommon with the cells that will make up my body in, say, seven years?” And, ofcourse, the question contains its own answer: what they have in common is thatthey both make up my body and therefore make up some kind of pattern throughtime that is supposedly my self. But we still don’t know what that pattern quathe self is; we have simply gone round in a circle. 

Philosophers willrecognize this little vignette as a variation on the example of the ship ofTheseus, which, every so often, has all of its planks replaced. The questionis, Is it the same ship or not? And philosophers, being more sophisticated thanmost of the rest of us, deftly reply that there really isn’t any fact of thematter one way or the other. It all depends on what you want to say. In onesense, yes, it is the same ship, and in another sense, no, it isn’t the sameship. It all depends on what your criteria of identity are. For something to bethe same (to have some kind of invariant pattern or form) it must suffer somechange, for otherwise one would not be able to recognize that it had stayed thesame. Conversely, for something to change there must also be some kind ofimplicit permanance that acts as a reference point in judging that a change hasoccurred. So the answer to the quandary is both yes and no, and the details ofany specific yes or no answer will depend on one’s criteria of identity in thegiven situation.[10](#10_9) 

But surely the self—my self—can’t depend on how someone chooses to look at it;it is, after all, a self in its own right. Perhaps, then, the ego-self is theowner of the body, of this form that can be seen in so many ways. Indeed, we donot say “I am a body” but “I have a body.” But justwhat is it that I have? This body, which I seem to own, is also the home fornumerous microorganisms. Do I own them? A strange idea, since often they seemto get the best of me. But who is it that they get the best of? 

Perhaps the mostdefinitive argument that we do not take our body as our self is that we canimagine a total body transplant, that is, the implantation of our mind insomeone else’s body (a favorite theme in science fiction), yet we would stillcount as ourselves. Perhaps, then, we should leave the material and look to themental aggregates for the basis of the self. 

### Feelings/Sensations

All experiences havesome kind of feeling tone, classifiable as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral,and as either bodily feeling or mental feeling. We are very concerned about ourfeelings. We strive endlessly to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Our feelings arecertainly self-relevant, and at moments of strong feeling we take ourselves asour feelings. Yet are they our self? Feelings change from moment to moment.(Awareness of these changes can be made even more precise inmindfulness/awareness practice: one develops firsthand experience of themomentary arising of feelings and sensations as well as their changes.) Thoughfeelings affect the self, no one would say that these feelings are the self. But what/who is it, then, that feelings areaffecting? 

### Perceptions/Impulses

This aggregate refers tothe first moment of recognition, identification, or discernment in the arisingof something distinct, coupled with the activation of a basic impulse foraction toward the discerned object. 

Within the context ofmindfulness/awareness practice, the coupling of discernment and impulse in amoment of experience is especially important. There are said to be three rootimpulses—passion/desire (toward desirable objects), aggression/anger (towardundesirable objects), and delusion/ignoring (toward neutral objects). Insofaras beings are caught up in habits of ego clinging, physical or mental objectsare discerned, even at the first instant, in relation to the self—either asdesirable, undesirable, or irrelevant to the self—andin that very discernment is the automatic impulse to act in the relevantfashion. These three basic impulses are also called the three poisons becausethey are the beginnings of actions that will lead to further ego grasping. Butwho is this ego who is grasping? 

### DispositionalFormations 

This next aggregaterefers to habitual patterns of thinking, feeling, perceiving, andacting—habitual patterns such as confidence, avarice, laziness, worry, etc.(see appendix B). We are now in the domain of the kinds of phenomena that couldwell be called cognitive in the language of cognitive science or personalitytraits in personality psychology. 

We are certainly heavilyself-invested in our habits and traits—our personality. If someone criticizesour behavior or makes a favorable comment about our personality, we feel thatshe is referring to our self. As in each of the other aggregates, our emotionalresponse indicates that we take this aggregate as our ego-self. But again whenwe contemplate the object of that response, our conviction falls apart. We donot normally identify our habits with our self. Our habits, motives, andemotional tendencies may change considerably over time, but we still feel asense of continuity as if there were a self distinct from these personalitychanges. Where could this sense of continuity come from, if not from a selfthat is the basis of our present personality? 

### Consciousnesses

Consciousness is thelast of the aggregates, and it contains all of the others. (Indeed, each of theaggregates contains those that precede it in the list.) It is the mentalexperience that goes with the other four aggregates; technically it is theexperience that comes from the contact of each sense organ with its object(together with the feeling, impulse, and habit that is aroused). Consciousness,as a technical term vijñana, always refers to thedualistic sense of experience in which there is an experiencer, an objectexperienced, and a relation (or relations) binding them together. 

Let us turn for a momentto the systematic description of consciousness made by one of the Abhidharmaschools (see appendix B). The mental factors are the relations that bind theconsciousness to its object, and at each moment a consciousness is dependent onits momentary mental factors (like the hand and its fingers).[11](#11_6)Note that the second, third, and fourth aggregates are included here as mentalfactors. Five of the mental factors are omnipresent; that is, in every momentof consciousness the mind is bound to its object by all five of these factors.There are contact between the mind and its object; aspecific feeling tone of pleasantness,unpleasantness, or neutrality; a discernment of theobject; an intention toward the object; and attention to the object. The rest of the factors, includingall the dispositions that make up the fourth aggregate, are not always present.Some of these factors can be present together in a given moment (such asconfidence and diligence), others are mutually exclusive (such as alertness anddrowsiness). The combination of mental factors that are present make up thecharacter—the color and taste—of a particular moment of consciousness. 

Is this Abhidharmaanalysis of consciousness a system of intentionality along Husserlian lines?There are similarities in that there is no consciousness without an object ofconsciousness and a relation. (Mind [sems] in the Tibetan tradition is oftendefined as “that which projects itself to other.”) But there are differences.Neither the objects of consciousness nor the mental factors arerepresentations. Most important, consciousness (vijñana) is only one mode ofknowing; prajña does not know by means of a subject/object relationship. Wemight call the simple experiential/psychological observation that consciousexperience takes a subject/object form proto­intentionality.12 Husserl’s theoryis based not only on protointentionality but also on Brentano’s notion ofintentionality as subsequently elaborated by Husserl into a full-fledgedrepresentational theory.[13](#13_5) 

The temporalrelationship between a consciousness and its object was the subject of greatdispute among the Abhidharma schools: some held that the occurrence of theobject and of mind was simultaneous; others, that the object occurred first,followed in the succeeding moment by the mind (first a sight, then the seeing consciousness).A third claim was that mind and object were simultaneous for sight, sound,smell, taste, and touch but that the thinking consciousness took as its objectthe preceding moment of thought. This dispute became integral to philosophicaldebates about what things actually existed. There were also disputes aboutwhich factors to include and how they were to be characterized. 

Despite the atmosphereof debate that surrounded some issues, there was unanimous agreement on themore experientially direct claim that each of the senses (eye, ear, nose,tongue, body, and mind) had a different consciousness (recall Jackendoff)—thatis, at each moment of experience there was a different experiencer as well as adifferent object of experience. And of course there was agreement that noactual self was to be found in consciousness, either in the experiencer, theobject of experience, or the mental factors binding them together. 

In our habitual andunreflective state, of course, we impute continuity of consciousness to all ourexperience—so much so that consciousness always occurs in a “realm,” anapparently cohering total environment with its own complete logic (ofaggression, poverty, etc.).[14](#14_5) But this apparent totality andcontinuity of consciousness masks the discontinuity of momentaryconsciousnesses related to one another by cause and effect. A traditionalmetaphor for this illusory continuity is the lighting of one candle with asecond candle, a third candle from that one, and so on—the flame is passed fromone candle to the next without any material basis being passed on. Taking thissequence as a real continuity, however, we cling tenaciously to thisconsciousness and are terrorized by the possibility of its termination indeath. Yet when mindfulness/awareness reveals the disunity of this experience—asight, a sound, a thought, another thought, and so on—it becomes obvious thatconsciousness as such cannot be taken as that self we so treasure and for whichwe are now searching. 

We seem unable to find aself anywhere in each aggregate when we take them one by one. Perhaps, then,all the aggregates combine in some way to form the self. Is the self the sameas the totality of the aggregates? This idea would be quite attractive if onlywe knew how to make it work. Each aggregate taken singly is transitory andimpermanent; how, then, are we to combine them into something lasting andcoherent? Perhaps the self is an emergent property ofthe aggregates? In fact, many people when pressed to define the self (perhapsin a psychology class) will use the concept of an emergent as a solution.Indeed, given the contemporary scientific interest in the emgerent andself-organizing properties of certain complex aggregates, this idea is evenplausible. At this point, however, the idea is of no help. Such aself-organizing or synergistic mechanism is not evident in experience. Moreimportant, it is not the abstract idea of an emergent self that we cling to sofiercely as our ego; we cling to a “real” ego-self. 

When we recognize thatno such real self is given to us in our experience, we may swing to theopposite extreme, which is to say that the self must be radically differentfrom the aggregates. In the Western tradition, this move is best exemplified inthe Cartesian and Kantian claim that the observed regularity or pattern ofexperience requires that there be an agent or mover behind the pattern. ForDescartes, this mover was the res cogitans, thethinking substance. Kant was more subtle and precise. In his Critique of Pure Reason, he wrote, “Consciousness of selfaccording to the determinations of our state in inner perception is merelyempirical, and always changing. No fixed and abiding self can present itself inthis flux of inner appearances. … [Thus] there must be a condition whichprecedes all experience, and which makes experience itself possible. … Thispure original unchangeable consciousness I shall name transcendentalapperception.”15 Apperception basically means awareness, especiallyawareness of the process of cognition. Kant saw quite clearly that there wasnothing given in this experience of awareness that corresponded to the self,and so he argued that there must be a consciousness that is transcendental,that precedes all experience and makes that experience possible. Kant alsothought that this transcendental awareness is responsible for our sense ofunity and identity through time, thus his full term for the transcendentalground of the everyday self was “the transcendental unity of apperception.” 

Kant’s analysis isbrilliant, but it only heightens the predicament. We are told that there reallyis a self, but we can never know it. Furthermore, this self hardly answers toour emotional convictions: it is not me or my self; it is just the idea of a self in general, of someimpersonal agent or mover behind experience. It is pure, original, andunchangeable; I am impure and transitory. How could such a radically differentself have any relation with my experience? How could it be the condition orground of all of my experiences and yet remain untouched by those experiences?If there truly is such a self, it can be relevant to experience only bypartaking of the world’s fabric of dependency, but to do so would obviouslyviolate its pristine, absolute condition. 

We may present thedifference between the Kantian and the mindfulness/awareness views of self inthe form of a diagram (see [figures 4.1](#fig_001_1)–[4.3](#fig_003_1)). In both the Kantian andthe mindfulness/awareness traditions, there is, as we have seen, a recognitionof the absence of a substantial self in the momentariness of experience ([figure 4.1](#fig_001_1)). The Kantian moveavoids confronting the puzzle of our tendency to believe in a self in the faceof this momentariness by positing a pure, original, and unchangeableconsciousness as a ground—the transcendental ego ([figure 4.2](#fig_002_1)). In themindfulness/awareness tradition, the attitude is to hold the puzzle of thismomentariness vividly in mind by considering that the grasping toward a selfcould occur within any given moment of experience ([figure 4.3](#fig_003_1)).

[Figure 4.2](#fig_002a_1) Postulation of atranscendental self as a ground for the momentariness of experience. 

At this point the readerwill probably become rather irritated and say, “Fine, the self isn’t really alasting and coherent thing; it is just the continuity of the stream ofexperience. It is a process and not a thing. What’sthe big deal?” But remember, we have been looking for a self that answers toour emotional/reactional convictions. At this immediate experiential level, wedo not feel as if the self is merely the stream ofexperience. Indeed, even to call it a stream reveals our grasping after somesense of solidity, for this metaphor implies that experience flowscontinuously. But when we subject this continuity to analysis, we seem able tofind only discontinuous moments of feeling, perception, motivation, andawareness. We could, of course, redefine the self in all sorts of ways to getaround these problems, perhaps even by following contemporary analyticphilosophers who use quite sophisticated logical techniques, such as possibleworld semantics, but none of these new accounts would in any way explain ourbasic reactional behavior and everyday tendencies. 

The point is not whetherwe can redefine the self in some way that makes us comfortable orintellectually satisfied, nor is it to determine whether there really is anabsolute self that is nonetheless inaccessible to us. The point is rather todevelop mindfulness of and insight into our situation as we experience it hereand now. As Tsultrim Gyamtso remarks, “Buddhism is not telling anyone that heshould believe that he has a self or that he does not have a self. It is sayingthat when one looks at the way one suffers and the way one thinks and respondsemotionally to life, it is as if one believed there were a selfthat was lasting, single and independent and yet on closer analysis no suchself can be found. In other words, the aggregates (skandhas)are empty of a self.”[16](#16_5) 

## Momentarinessand the Brain 

Nonmeditating modernreaders may be feeling somewhat frustrated at this point. “But what about thebrain?” they may ask. It is a general trend in our scientific culture to shuntquestions about the mind and consciousness to the brain: if we can assume thefunctioning of the brain to be continuous and unified, then we can assume ourmind to be continuous. We are not talking here about a philosophical assumption(which would be inflammatorily debatable) but about a psychological attitude.Although, strictly speaking, in the Abhidharma context we have already takencare of this question with our discussion of the first aggregate of form, thepossibility of a dialogue about momentariness with neuroscience has been leftcompletely open—is there any evidence for momentariness in the functioning ofthe brain? 

Let us be clear aboutwhat we are investigating. An examination of experience withmindfulness/awareness reveals that one’s experience is discontinuous—a momentof consciousness arises, appears to dwell for an instant, and then vanishes, tobe replaced by the next moment.[17](#17_5) Is this description of experience(the kind of description of actual human experience that we have been askingfor) consonant or not consonant with descriptions that we get fromneuroscience? Notice that we are not talking about a direction of causality.And we are not dependent on neuroscience to validate experience; that would bescientific imperialism. We are simply interested, in as open a way as possible,in what neuroscience has to say about the issue of momentariness. 

There is a literature inneuroscience and psychology that can be referred to as “perceptual framing,”which deals with sensorimotor rhythmicity and parsing. One of the most wellknown phenomena studied in this literature is called “perceptual simultaneity”or “apparent motion.” For example, if two lights are shown successively with aninterval less than a period of 0.1–0.2 seconds, they will be seen assimultaneous, or in apparent simultaneity. If the interval is slightlyincreased, the flashing lights will appear to be in rapid motion. If theinterval is increased further, the appearance of motion becomes distinctlysequential. There are examples of this phenomenon that are quite familiar:advertisment displays often have a row of flashing lights with the last lightshaped as an arrow. One set of lights turns on, and then the next, and thenext, giving one the impression that the lights are jumping from one place tothe other in the direction of the arrow. 

It is well known that the brain has a periodic rhythm of activity,which is detectable in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Since the dominantrhythm for the visual cortex is also about 0.15 seconds, it is natural toassume that there is a relationship between temporal framing and cortical alpharhythm. 

This relationship can betested experimentally.[18](#18_5) [Figure 4.4](#fig_004_1) displays theexperimental design. A subject was taken and fitted with surface electrodes sothat the dominant 0.1 seconds rhythm (the so-called alpha rhythm) could beextracted from the electrical activity in his cortex. That rhythm was then usedto trigger on and off the lights that are depicted in front of the subject. Itis well known that if one puts the on-off timing of those lights within acertain range, the subject will say that the lights are on simultaneously. Anddepending on how much one enlarges the interval, the subject will say eitherthat the lights move from one position to another or are sequential. If theinterstimulus interval (the time between the first light being on and thesecond being on) is less than 50 milliseconds, then the lights are reported assimultaneous. If it is over 100 milliseconds, then the lights are reported assequential. In between these two intervals the lights appear to move. 

![9739_004_fig_004.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image021.png)

[Figure 4.4](#fig_004a_1) Experimental setupto investigate the natural parsing of perceptual events. See text fordescription. From Varela et al., Perceptual framing and cortical alpha rhythm. 

In this experiment,however, the subject was asked how he saw the set of lights at differentmoments of his own cortical rhythm. [Figure 4.5](#fig_005_1)presents some of the results. Of the three bars in [figure 4.5](#fig_005_1), the middle bar represents what the subjectsaw when there was no correlation between his brain rhythm and the lights. Herethe interval between the lights is set so that there is an almost chance levelof seeing them as either simultaneous or in apparent motion. On either side ofthe middle bar, there is a correlation between the perception of the lights andthe cortical rhythm at two of its phases—the positive peak and the negativepeak. If the two lights are started at the negative peak, the subject sees themalmost always as simultaneous. If they are started at the positive peak, thenthe subject sees them in apparent motion. The temporal distance between thelights has not been changed; all that has been changed is the moment at whichthe subject has been presented with the lights. 

![9739_004_fig_005.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image023.png)

[Figure 4.5](#fig_005a_1) Results ofexperiments revealing temporal parsing of perceptual events around 100–150msec. See text for more details. 

Experiments such asthese suggest that there is a natural parsing in the visual frame and that suchframing is at least partially and locally related to the rhythm of one’s brainin the range of duration of about 0.1–0.2 seconds at its minimum. Roughlystated, if the lights are presented at the beginning of the frame, thelikelihood of seeing them occur simultaneously is much greater than if they arepresented toward the end of the frame: when they are presented toward the endof the visual frame, the second light can fall, as it were, in the next frame.Everything that falls within a frame will be treated by the subject as if itwere within one time span, one “now.” 

Such neural parsing isto be expected given the fact that the brain is not a sequence of relaystations from the retina to the muscles. At each level there are strongreciprocal and branching connections, so that the entire network can operateonly by a large amount of cooperative, back-and-forth matching of activity atall levels. Furthermore, it has become evident that neurons in the centralnervous system have a rich diversity of electrical properties based on ionicconductances that endow them with auto­rhythmic oscillatory properties. Thisentire cooperative activity takes a certain time to start and to culminate.Such oscillations/resonances can be seen as timing sensorimotor coordination(among other possible functional roles).[19](#19_5)

In the case at hand, therhythm is closely linked to the reciprocal connections and reverberationsbetween the thalamus and the visual cortex. In fact, there is good evidencethat the activity of a neuron in the thalamus and the cortex of mammals has aunitary time course of about 100 milliseconds following a burst of presynapticinput.[20](#20_5) Furthermore, it is generallyaccepted that the alpha rhythm is the result of synchronized thalamocorticalreverberations and synchronously firing neuronal groups.[21](#21_5)These are but a few indications of the basis of a temporal frame. We will comeback to examine visual perceptual events on the basis of self-organizingnetwork operations in more detail in the next chapter. 

It should be remarkedthat the critical period of about 0.15 seconds seems to be the minimum amountof time it takes for a describable and recognizable percept to arise. Beyondthis minimum, of course, the unitary nature of a more complex conceptualizationcan last much longer—up to about 0.5 seconds. This limit can be revealed in thecomponents of the cortical activity known as event-related potentials. Thebasic idea is, again, to use a stimulus that is time locked and to have asubject wear a set of electrodes so that a large number of samples from itssurface electrical activity can be collected. Theseevent-related potentials (ERPs) are notoriously noisy, as can be expected froma remote sensing of a large body of neurons. But recent methods usingalgorithms that learn to recognize significant correlation have begun to giveimages of these “shadows of thought.”[22](#22_5)

[Figure 4.6a](#fig_006) shows, for example, amontage of fifteen electrodes over the entire head of a subject. In this studythe task was to estimate the distance a target should be moved to estimate adisplayed arrow’s trajectory. The “move” task required pressure on a buttonunder the right finger with a force proportional to that distance. In contrast,in the “no move” task the arrow pointed directly at the target, and no pressingwas required. Thus although the gross stimulus conditions were comparable, thespatial judgments and response differed between the two cases. [Figure 4.6b](#fig_006) displays the ERP forthe two tasks. It is evident that they differ only in the 300–500 msec range,not before or after. Furthermore, as [figure4.6c](#fig_006) shows, the regions of the brain’s mass activity in differentmoments and different tasks are like moving clouds of electrical activity thatappear to shift and subside—an electrical shadow of the momentariness ofexperience. 

![9739_004_fig_006.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image025.png)

This neuropsychologicalperspective is interesting for our purposes because the parsing of experiencenaturally corresponds to the aggregates of the mindfulness/awarenesspractitioner. In fact, the phenomenon of parsing is not evident at first glancefor either the neuropsychologist or the practitioner. But it can be revealedthrough a disciplined method of examining experience, such asmindfulness/awareness. 

It is an interesting question, from the standpoint ofmindfulness/awareness practice, whether the aggregates express a direct observationof components arising sequentially (whether there is a sequence of developmentimplied in listing them individually), or whether they arise simultaneouslyfrom moment to moment (the listing is an inferred decomposition). This issueprovides a classical example of how descriptions might change as a function ofone’s habits of attention and observation, perhaps as a function of thecontextual purpose of the description (who is being taught about the aggregatesand for what reason). The descriptions of some authors do at times seem toindicate that the aggregates are sequential,[23](#c4_note_23)but other descriptions (in particular the more classical texts less concernedwith the question) are not very explicit about the issue at all;[24](#24_3)this makes perfect sense given the function of the description of theaggregates in Buddhist discourse. 

Even when one does takeas an object of inquiry whether the aggregates are sequential or simultaneous,for most people the aggregates appear phenomenologically to arise too rapidlyfor them to tell. In consonance with neurophysiological observations of thebrief timing of a unit of experience, the aggregates seem to arise as apackage. For example, even from an information-processing point of view incontemporary cognitive psychology, form and discernment would appear to specifyeach other. Form can be seen as the arising of something distinct from abackground (a figure from a background), but discernment is not the simpleregistering of the distinction: it is an active (that is, top-down) process ofconceptualization that enables even simple distinctions of form to bediscerned. Neither form nor discernment is simply given beforehand: as we haveseen, we frame our perceptions as intentional items. 

On the other hand, theneurophysiological observations indicate (as shown, for example, in [figure 4.6](#fig_006)) that the initialstages of perceptual organization (at least in these laboratory conditions andfor simple visuomotor patterns) precede the more cognitively related electricalcorrelates by some 100–200 milliseconds. This time difference might just be toofast for detailed attention except when training in attention has stabilizedsufficiently to notice the difference. Even so, it is quite remarkable thatsuch fine points of observation could be made, presented, and repeatedlyvalidated by practitioners centuries apart, in terms that make the comparisonwith neuropsychological evidence quite possible and intriguing. 

Furthermore, what isavailable to an experienced meditator is not necessarily available to abeginner. In particular, this example of the analysis of the aggregateshighlights the process of change that one’s awareness/attention undergoes inthe open-ended stance proposed by mindfulness/awareness. As we outlined inchapter 2, the foundation of mindfulness/awareness practice is the cultivationof mindfulness through a relaxed focusing on the arising of every moment ofexperience, whether during sitting periods (the “laboratory” situation ofmindfulness/awareness) or in daily life. By paying attention over and overagain to the details of our embodied situation, awareness of what happensbecomes more and more spontaneous. What at the beginning are simply mereflickers of a thought or an emotion become sharper and more apparent in thedetails of their arising. Through further development, the attention paid tomental movements is sufficiently subtle and quick that mindfulness actually hasto be dropped as a distinct attitude. At this point, mindfulness is eitherspontaneously present or it is not. Then as this inseparability betweenawareness and mental movement stabilizes further, observations of the fineprogression of the aggregates (whether sequential or simultaneous) from momentto moment become possible. 

This progression ofattention has received even further and more detailed consideration in theBuddhist tradition, but we have presented enough of its basic development forour purposes here. We can now bring this chapter to a close by returning to thetheme with which we began: the nature of the ego-self. 

## The Aggregates without a Self 

It might appear that inour search for a self in the aggregates we have come out empty handed.Everything that we tried to grasp seemed to slip through our fingers, leavingus with the sense that there is nothing to hold on to. At this point, it isimportant to pause and again remind ourselves of just what it was that we wereunable to find. 

We did not fail to findthe physical body, though we had to admit that its designation as my body depends very much on how we choose to look atthings. Nor did we fail to locate our feelings or sensations, and we also foundour various perceptions. We found dispositions, volitions, motivations—inshort, all those things that make up our personality and emotional sense ofself. We also found all the various forms in which we can be aware—awareness ofseeing and hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, even awareness of our ownthought processes. So the only thing we didn’t find was a truly existing selfor ego. But notice that we did find experience. Indeed, we entered the very eyeof the storm of experience, we just simply could discern there no self, no “I.”

Why then do we feelempty handed? We feel this way because we tried to grasp something that wasnever there in the first place. This grasping goes on all the time; it is exactlythe deep-rooted emotional response that conditions all of our behavior andshapes all of the situations in which we live. It is for this reason that thefive aggregates are glossed as the “aggregates of grasping” (upadanaskandha). We—that is, our personality, which islargely dispositional formations—cling to the aggregates as if they were theself when, in fact, they are empty (sunya) of a self.And yet despite this emptiness of ego-self, the aggregates are full ofexperience. How is this possible? 

The progressivedevelopment of insight enhances the experience of calm mindfulness and expandsthe space within which all experiential arisings occur. As this practicedevelops, one’s immediate attitude (not simply one’s after-the-factreflections) becomes more and more focused on the awareness that theseexperiences—thoughts, dispositions, perceptions, feelings, andsensations—cannot be pinned down. Our habitual clinging to them is itself onlyanother feeling, another disposition of our mind. 

This arising andsubsiding, emergence and decay, is just that emptiness of self in theaggregates of experience. In other words, the very fact that the aggregates arefull of experience is the same as the fact that they are empty of self. Ifthere were a solid, really existing self hidden in or behind the aggregates,its unchangeableness would prevent any experience from occurring; its staticnature would make the constant arising and subsiding of experience come to ascreeching halt. (It is not surprising, therefore, that techniques ofmeditation that presuppose the existence of such a self proceed by closing offthe senses and denying the world of experience.) But that circle of arising anddecay of experience turns continuously, and it can do so only because it is emptyof a self. 

In this chapter we haveseen not only that cognition and experience do not appear to have a trulyexisting self but also that the habitual belief in such an ego-self, thecontinual grasping to such a self, is the basis of the origin and continuationof human suffering and habitual patterns. In our culture, science hascontributed to the awakening of this sense of the lack of a fixed self but hasonly described it from afar. Science has shown us that a fixed self is notnecessary for mind but has not provided any way of dealing with the basic factthat this no-longer-needed self is precisely the ego-self that everyone clingsto and holds most dear. By remaining at the level of description, science hasyet to awaken to the idea that the experience of mind, not merely without someimpersonal, hypothetical, and theoretically constructed self but withoutego-self, can be profoundly transformative. 

Perhaps it is not fair to ask more of science. To borrow the words ofMerleau-Ponty, the strength of science may lie precisely in the fact that itgives up living among things, preferring to manipulate them instead.[25](#25_3) But if this preference expressesthe strength of science, it also indicates its weakness. By renouncing a lifeamid the things of experience, the scientist is able to remain relativelyunaffected by her discoveries.[26](#26_3) This situation has, perhaps, beentolerable for the past three hundred years, but it is fast becoming intolerablein our modern era of cognitive science. 

If science is tocontinue to maintain its position of de facto authority in a responsible andenlightened manner, then it must enlarge its horizon to include mindful, open-endedanalyses of experience, such as the one evoked here. Cognitivism, at least atthe moment, does not seem to be capable of such a step, given its narrowconception of cognition as the computation of symbols after the fashion ofdeductive logic. It would do well to remember, then, that cognitivism did notemerge ready made, like Athena from the head of Zeus. Only a few of itsexponents are sensitive to its roots in its earlier years and to the decisionsthat were subsequently made about which avenues of research to explore. Theseearlier years, however, have once more become a source of inspiration to a newand controversial approach to cognition in which the self-organizing qualitiesof biological aggregates play a central role. This approach sheds new light onall of the themes we have touched so far and takes us into part III of ourexploration.

[6.](#6_8) It is often said that in Buddhist “philosophy” thereis little interest in “ontology” or that ontology and epistemology are “notdistinguished.” This somewhat misses the point about what Buddhism isattempting to do and its orientation toward immediate, everyday experience.From the Buddhist point of view, ontology is simply a very strange category.

[7.](#7_8) Translations of these terms unfortunately varyconsiderably. The Sanscrit terms are rupa, vedana, samjna, samskara, and vijnana. The thirdand fourth terms are particularly difficult to translate. Thus samjna, for which we use “perception(discernment)/impulse,”has also been translated as “conceptualization,” “discernment,”“discrimination,” “perception,” and “recognition.” Samskarais even more problematic, having been rendered as “compositional factors,”“dispositions,” “emotional creations,” “formations,” “mental constructions,”“motivations,” and “volitions.” Since the basic idea behind this category isthat of the mental tendencies that are formative of one’s experiences, we havecoined the term “dispositional formations.”

[8.](#8_7) Kalupahana, Principles of BuddhistPsychology, presents an interesting but idiosyncratic account of thepsychophysical complex (nama-rupa) as the basiccategory of the Abhidharma. Both sides of the complex, the physical as well asthe psychological, are defined in terms of experience: the basic experientialoperation that defines the psychological is contact with concepts; that which definesthe physical is contact with resistance (the meaningof contact in the Abhidharma will be discussed inchapter 6). Phenomenologists might say that the nature of each of these is distinction, that is, the emergence of somethingdistinguishable from a background: in the physical modality, distinctions basedon sensory resistance, in the psychological modality, distinctions based onconcepts.

[17.](#17_4) One might think to reverse the figure and ground ofone’s investigations and ask whether there are not gaps as well asdiscontinuities between the moments of arising of consciousness. This questiontouches a crucial difference among Buddhist schools. According to the TheravadaAbhidhamma, thought moments are contiguous, even between one lifetime and thenext. At the other extreme, there are schools which teach that there can be anabsolute gap in the habitual thought process in which one can experience fullyawakened mind. The research that we are about to describe can certainly not lay claim to relevance for that issue. In the Buddhistliterature there are also mentions of the actual moments of time that it takesto switch from one moment to the next, which range anywhere from 13 to 100milliseconds; see E Conze, Buddhist Thought in India,282; this matter is also discussed by Hayward, ShiftingWorlds, Changing Minds, chapter 12.

[III ]()Varieties ofEmergence 

# [5 ]()Emergent Properties and Connectionism 

## Self-Organization: The Roots of an Alternative 

We now embark on thesecond stage of our exploration of the dialogue between cognitive science andthe examination of human experience through the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. In the first stage we saw how the notion ofthe cognitive agent as a bundle of representations plays a central role in bothpresent-day cognitivism and in the initial stages of the mindful, open-endedexamination of experience. In this second stage the dominant theme shifts tothe notion of emergent properties. This key notionhas a complex history, which provides the entry point for our presentation. 

Alternatives to thedominant approach of symbol manipulation in cognitive science were alreadyproposed and widely discussed during the early, formative years of cybernetics.At the Macy Conferences,[1](#1_11) for example, extensive discussionoccurred concerning the point that in actual brains there seem to be no rules,no central logical processor, nor does information appear to be stored inprecise addresses. Rather, brains can be seen to operate on the basis ofmassive interconnections in a distributed form, so that the actual connectionsamong ensembles of neurons change as a result of experience. In brief, theseensembles present us with a self-organizing capacity that is nowhere to befound in the paradigm for symbol manipulation. In 1958 Frank Rosenblatt builtthe “Perceptron,” a simple device with some capacity for recognition, purely onthe basis of the changes of connectivity among neuronlike components;[2](#2_11) similarly, W. R. Ashby did thefirst study of the dynamics of very large systems with random interconnections,showing that they exhibit coherent global behaviors.[3](#3_11)

The standard historywould have it that these alternative views were literally wiped out of theintellectual scene in favor of the computational ideas discussed in chapter 3.It was only in the late 1970s that an explosive rekindling of these ideas tookplace—after twenty-five years of dominance of the cognitivist orthodoxy (whatDaniel Dennett has amusingly termed “High Church Computationalism”).[4](#4_11) Certainly one of the contributingfactors in this renewed interest was the parallel rediscovery ofself-organizational ideas in physics and nonlinear mathematics, as well as theeasy access to fast computers. 

The recent motivation totake a second look into self-organization was based on two widely acknowledgeddeficiencies of cognitivism. The first is that symbolic information processingis based on sequential rules, applied one at a time.This “von Neumann bottleneck” is a dramatic limitation when the task at handrequires large numbers of sequential operations (such as image analysis orweather forecasting). A continued search for parallelprocessing algorithms has met with little success because the entirecomputational orthodoxy seems to run precisely counter to it. 

A second importantlimitation is that symbolic processing is localized: the loss or malfunction ofany part of the symbols or rules of the system results in a seriousmalfunction. In contrast, a distributed operation ishighly desirable, so that there is at least a relative equipotentiality andimmunity to mutilations. 

The culmination of experience in the first two decades of thecognitivist dominance can best be expressed by noting a conviction that grewgradually among the community of researchers: it is necessary to invert theexpert and the child in the scale of performances. The first attempts weredirected at solving the most general problems, such as natural languagetranslation or the problem of devising a “general problem solver.” Theseattempts, which tried to match the intelligence of a person who is a highlytrained expert, were seen as tackling the interesting, hard issues. As theattempts became more modest and local, it became apparent that the deeper andmore fundamental kind of intelligence is that of a baby who can acquirelanguage from dispersed daily utterances and can constitute meaningful objectsfrom what seems to be a sea of lights. Cognitivist architectures had moved toofar from biological inspirations; one does not wish to reduce the cognitive tothe biological, but the most ordinary tasks are done faster when performed evenby tiny insects than is possible when they are attempted with a computationalstrategy of the type proposed in the cognitivist orthodoxy. Similarly, theresiliency of the brain to resist damage, or the flexibility of biologicalcognition to adjust to new environments without compromising all of itscompetence, is taken for granted by neurobiologists but is nowhere to be seenin the computational paradigm. 

## TheConnectionist Strategy 

In this alternativeorientation in cognitive science, then, the brain has once more become the mainsource of metaphors and ideas. Theories and models no longer begin withabstract symbolic descriptions but with a whole army of neurallike, simple,unintelligent components, which, when appropriately connected, have interestingglobal properties. These global properties embody and express the cognitivecapacities being sought. 

The entire approachdepends, then, on introducing the appropriate connections, which is usuallydone through a rule for the gradual change of connections starting from afairly arbitrary initial state. The most thoroughly explored learning rule is“Hebb’s Rule.” In 1949 Donald Hebb suggested that learning could be based inchanges in the brain that stem from the degree of correlated activity betweenneurons: if two neurons tend to be active together, their connection isstrengthened; otherwise it is diminished. Therefore, the system’s connectivity becomesinseparable from its history of transformation and related to the kind of taskdefined for the system. Since the real action happens at the level of theconnections, the name connectionism (often called neoconnectionism) has beenproposed for this direction of research.[5](#5_11)

One of the importantfactors contributing to the explosive interest in this approach today was theintroduction of some effective methods of following the changes that can occurin these networks. Great attention has been given to the introduction ofstatistical measures that provide the system with a global energy function thatpermits one to follow how the system arrives into convergent states.[6](#6_11) 

Let us consider anexample. Take a total number (say N) of simpleneuronlike elements and connect them reciprocally. Next present this systemwith a succession of patterns by treating some of its nodes as sensory ends (aretina if you wish). After each presentation let the system reorganize itselfby rearranging its connections following a Hebbian principle, that is, byincreasing the links between those neurons that happen to be active togetherfor the item presented. The presentation of an entire list of patternsconstitutes the system’s learning phase. 

After the learningphase, when the system is presented again with one of these patterns, itrecognizes it, in the sense that it falls into a unique global state orinternal configuration that is said to represent the learned item. Thisrecognition is possible provided the number of patterns presented is not largerthan a fraction of the total number of participating neurons (about 0.15 N). Furthermore, the systemperforms a correct recognition even if the pattern is presented with addednoise or the system is partially mutilated.[7](#7_11)

## Emergenceand Self-Organization 

This example is but oneof a whole class of neural network or connectionist models, which we shalldiscuss further. But first we need to broaden the discussion to understand whatis at stake in studying these networks. The strategy, as we said, is to build acognitive system not by starting with symbols and rules but by starting withsimple components that would dynamically connect to each other in dense ways.In this approach, each component operates only in its local environment, sothat there is no external agent that, as it were, turns the system’s axle. Butbecause of the system’s network constitution, there is a global cooperationthat spontaneously emerges when the states of all participating “neurons” reacha mutually satisfactory state. In such a system, then, there is no need for acentral processing unit to guide the entire operation.[8](#c5_note_8)This passage from local rules to global coherence is the heart of what used tobe called self-organization during the cybernetic years.[9](#9_11)Today people prefer to speak of emergent or global properties, networkdynamics, nonlinear networks, complex systems, or even synergetics. 

There is no unifiedformal theory of emergent properties. It is clear, however, that emergentproperties have been found across all domains—vortices and lasers, chemicaloscillations, genetic networks, developmental patterns, population genetics,immune networks, ecology, and geophysics. What all these diverse phenomena havein common is that in each case a network gives rise to new properties, whichresearchers try to understand in all their generality.[10](#10_11) One of the most useful ways ofcapturing the emergent properties that these various systems have in common isthrough the notion of an “attractor” in dynamical systems theory. Since thisidea will be of importance for the rest of our discussion, let us pause toconsider it through an example.[11](#11_8) 

Consider a cellular automata, a simple unit that receives inputs fromtwo immediate neighbors and communicates its internal state to the sameimmediate neighbors. Assume that the cell or unit can be in only two states (0or 1, active or inactive) and that the rule governing the change in eachautomata is simply a (Boolean) function of two arguments (such as “and” or“exclusive or”). Since we can choose such a function for each one of the twostates of the cellular automata, the operation of each unit is completelyspecified by a pair of Boolean functions. 

Instead of working witha complex network, we simply connect a string of such elementary units into acircular array, so that there is no input and output from the entire ring, onlyinternal actions. For the purpose of display, however, it is easier to cut thisring open and to present it linearly, with the cells in the 1 state indicatedby a black square and those in the opposite state indicated by a blank space.Accordingly, in the display in [figure 5.1](#fig_001_2), the cellular position runs from left toright (with the last cell linked to the first one, according to the chosen ringarchitecture).

[Figure 5.1](#fig_001a_2) Constructing asimple cellular automaton. 

This ring of cellularautomata acquires a dynamics by starting at some random state and letting eachcell reach an updated state at each (discrete) moment of time in a synchronousfashion (i.e., all of the cells reach their respective states together). In thedisplay, we represent the initial instant at the topmost row and successiveinstants of time going downward. Thus the successive states of the same cellcan be read as a column, and the simultaneous states of all cells can be readas a row. In all the simulations presented in [figure 5.2](#fig_002_2), the ring wascomposed of eighty cells, and its initial starting state was chosen at random.

[Figure 5.2](#fig_002a_2) Emergentcooperative patterns (or “attractors”) in cellular automata. 

It is remarkable toobserve that even this simple, almost minimal network has rich self-organizingcapacities. A thorough examination of its capacities has been conductedrecently by S. Wolfram.[12](#12_6) We will not recapitulate his workhere. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that dynamically these ringsfall into four major classes or attractors, as illustrated in [figure 5.2](#fig_002_2). A first classexhibits a simple attractor, which leads all cells to become homogenouslyactive or inactive. For a second, more interesting class of rings the rulesgive rise to spatial periodicities, that is, some cells remain active whileothers do not. For a third class the rules give rise to spatiotemporal cyclesof length two or longer. These last two classes correspond to cyclicattractors. Finally, for a few rules the dynamics seem to give rise to chaoticattractors, where one does not detect any regularities in space or time. 

The basic point we areillustrating here is that the emergence of global patterns or configurations insystems of interacting elements is neither an oddity of isolated cases norunique to neural systems. In fact, it seems difficult for any densely connectedaggregate to escape emergent properties; thus theories of such properties are anatural link for different levels of descriptions in natural and cognitivephenomena. With this larger view of self-organization in mind, let us return nowto neural networks and connectionism. 

## ConnectionismToday 

Connectionist theoriesprovide, with amazing grace, working models for a number of interestingcognitive capacities, such as rapid recognition, associative memory, andcategorical generalization. The current enthusiasm for this orientation isjustified on several counts. First, cognitivist AI and neuroscience had fewconvincing results to account for (or reconstruct) the kinds of cognitiveprocesses introduced above. Second, connectionist models are much closer tobiological systems; thus one can work with a degree of integration between AIand neuroscience that was hitherto unthinkable. Third, in experimentalpsychology connectionist models facilitate a return to a behavioristorientation, which circumvents theorizing in terms of high-level, commonsense, mentalisticconstructs (a style of theory that had been legitimated by cognitivism butabout which psychology remained ambivalent). Finally, the models are generalenough to be applied, with little modification, to various domains, such asvision or speech recognition. 

There is a variety ofexamples of emergent neural states for tasks that require no learning, such aseye movements or ballistic limb movements. Obviously, most of the cognitivetasks one wishes to understand involve experience-dependent transformations,hence the interest in learning rules such as Hebb’s, which we introduced in ourfirst example. Such rules provide a neural network not just with emergentconfigurations (as was the case even for our simple ring automaton) but withthe capacity to synthesize new configurations according to experience. 

We are not going toreview here this developing field of research into plastic neural networks andtheir applications to the study of the brain and artificial intelligence.[13](#13_7) It is sufficient for our purposesto point out that there are two major classes of learning methods currentlybeing explored. The first one, illustrated by Hebb’s rule and inspired by brainmechanisms, is learning by correlation: the system ispresented with a whole series of examples and is molded by it for futureencounters. The second alternative is learning by copying,that is, by having a model that acts as an active instructor. This strategy is,in fact, the one proposed early on by Rosenblatt in his Perceptron. In itsmodern version it is known as “backpropagation.” In this technique, changes inthe neuronal connections inside the network (called “hidden units”) areassigned so as to minimize the difference between the network’s response andwhat is expected of it.[14](#14_7) Here learning resembles someonetrying to imitate an instructor. NetTalk, a celebrated recent example of thismethod, is a grapheme-­phoneme conversion machine that works by being shown afew pages of an English text in its learning phase. As a result, NetTalk canread aloud a new text in what many listeners consider deficient butcomprehensible English.[15](#15_6) 

## NeuronalEmergences 

Recent work has producedsome detailed evidence that emergent properties are fundamental to theoperation of the brain itself. This point is hardly surprising if one looks atthe details of the brain’s anatomy. In fact, since the time of Sherrington andPavlov the understanding of global distributed properties has been an El Doradoof neuroscience, one that is difficult to reach. The reasons for thesedifficulties have been both technical and conceptual. They have been technicalbecause it is not easy to know what myriad neurons dispersed over the brain aresimultaneously doing. Only recently have some of the methods become trulyeffective.[16](#16_7) But the difficulties have alsobeen conceptual, for neuroscientists had a strong preference during the 60s and70s for looking at the brain through cognitivist glasses. Thusinformation-processing metaphors based on the belief that the brain can bedescribed as a von Neumann computer were more in vogue than emergent networkdescriptions. 

Information-processingmetaphors are, however, of limited use. For example, although neurons in thevisual cortex do have distinct responses to specific features of the visualstimuli, these responses occur only in an anesthetized animal with a highlysimplified internal and external environment. When more normal sensorysurroundings are allowed and the animal is studied awake and behaving, it hasbecome increasingly clear that stereotyped neuronal responses become highlycontext sensitive. There are, for example, distinct effects produced by bodilytilt or auditory stimulation.[17](#17_7) Furthermore, the neuronalresponse characteristics depend directly on neurons localized far from theirreceptive fields.[18](#18_7) Even a change in posture, whilepreserving the same identical sensorial stimulation, alters the neuronalresponses in the primary visual cortex, demonstrating that even the seeminglyremote motorium is in resonance with the sensorium.[19](#19_7)A symbolic, stage-by-stage description for a system with this type ofconstitution seems to go against the grain. 

It has, therefore,become increasingly clear to neuroscientists that one needs to study neurons asmembers of large ensembles that are constantly disappearing and arising throughtheir cooperative interactions and in which every neuron has multiple andchanging responses in a context-dependent manner. A rule for the constitutionof the brain is that if a region (nucleus, layer) Aconnects to B, then Bconnects reciprocally back to A. This law ofreciprocity has only two or three minor exceptions. The brain is thus a highlycooperative system: the dense interconnections among its components entail thateventually everything going on will be a function of what all the componentsare doing. 

This kind ofcooperativeness holds both locally and globally: it functions within subsystemsof the brain and at the level of the connections among those subsystems. Onecan take the entire brain and divide it into subsections, depending on thekinds of cells and areas, such as the thalamus, hypocampus, cortical gyri, etc.These subsections are made up of complex networks of cells, but they alsorelate to each other in a network fashion. As a result the entire systemacquires an internal coherence in intricate patterns, even if we cannot sayexactly how this occurs. For example, if one artificially mobilizes thereticular system, an organism will change behaviorally from, say, being awaketo being asleep. This change does not indicate, however, that the reticularsystem is the controller of wakefulness. That system is, rather, a form ofarchitecture in the brain that permits certain internal coherences to arise.But when these coherences arise, they are not simply due to any particularsystem. The reticular system is necessary but not sufficient for certaincoherent states, such as wakefulness and sleep. It is the animal that is asleepor awake, not the reticular neurons. In fact, there are many levels ofresolution at which such neuronal emergences can be studied, from the level ofcellular properties to entire brain regions, each level of detail requiring adifferent methodology.[20](#20_7) 

Consider what happens in visual perception in its peripheral stages.The first diagram in [figure 5.3](#fig_003_2) displays the visual pathways of the brain.The optic nerve connects from the eyes to a region in the thalamus called thelateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from there to the visual cortex. Thestandard information-processing description (still found in textbooks and popularaccounts) is that information enters through the eyes and is relayedsequentially through the thalamus to the cortex where “further processing” iscarried out. But if one looks closely at the way the whole system is puttogether, one finds little to support this view of sequentiality. The seconddiagram in [figure 5.3](#fig_003_2)depicts the way the LGN is embedded in the brain network. It is evident that 80percent of what any LGN cell listens to comes not from the retina but from the denseinterconnectedness of other regions of the brain. Furthermore, one can see thatthere are more fibers coming from the cortex down to the LGN than there aregoing in the reverse direction. To look at the visual pathways as constitutinga sequential processer seems entirely arbitrary; one could just as easily seethe sequence moving in the reverse direction. 

![9739_005_fig_003.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image031.png)

[Figure 5.3](#fig_003a_2) Connections in thevisual pathway of mammals at the thalamic level. 

Thus even at the most peripheralend of the visual system, the influences that the brain receives from the eyeare met by more activity that flows out from the cortex. The encounter of thesetwo ensembles of neuronal activity is one moment in the emergence of a newcoherent configuration, depending on a sort of resonance or activematch-mismatch between the sensory activity and the internal setting at theprimary cortex.[21](#21_7) The primary visual cortex is,however, but one of the partners in this particular neuronal local circuit atthe LGN level. Other partners, such as the reticular formation, the fiberscoming from the superior colliculus, or the corollary discharge of neurons thatcontrol eye movements, play an equally active role.[22](#22_7)Thus the behavior of the whole system resembles a cocktail party conversationmuch more than a chain of command. 

What we have describedfor the LGN and vision is, of course, a uniform principle throughout the brain.Vision is useful as a case study since the details are better known than formost other nuclei and cortical areas. An individual neuron participates in manysuch global patterns and bears little significance when taken individually. Inthis sense, the basic mechanism of recognition of a visual object or a visualattribute could be said to be the emergence of a global state among resonating neuronal ensembles. 

In fact, StephenGrossberg has pioneered a detailed analysis of such adaptive resonant neuronalnetworks;[23](#23_6) the skeleton of one known as ART(from adaptive resonance theory) is shown in [figure 5.4](#fig_004_2). These models are interesting because they match theoverall architecture in the visual pathways that we have just outlined, whileat the same time they are mathematically precise, thus permitting simulationsand artificial implementation. ART is capable of self-organizing,self-stabilizing, and self-scaling a recognition “code” (a set of stabilizedinternal configurations) in response to arbitrary sequences of arbitrarily manyinput patterns. The core of ART is two successive stages (labeled F1 and F2 in [figure 5.4](#fig_004_2) andreminiscent of the LGN and visual cortex) that respond to activation patternsin short-term memory (STM). This bottom-up stream meets a bottom-down streamthrough the activation of long-term memory (LTM) traces. The rest of ARTmodulates STM and LTM processes, such as grain control and wave resetting.Carpenter and Grossberg find that during the self-organizing phase“attentional” mechanisms are critical for learning; these mechanisms appearwhen there is mismatch between bottom-up and top-down patterns. These resonantnetworks have been shown to be capable of rapidly learning to categorizevarious streams of input, such as letters into classes, without a predefinedlist. All the rules in ART describe emergent properties of parallel networkinteractions.

At this point we wouldlike to return to the topic of emergent biological processes and the fiveaggregates discussed in the previous chapter. We raised the issue there ofwhether the aggregates arise sequentially or simultaneously. Within thetraditional Buddhist texts, this issue rarely arises, largely because theaggregates do not constitute an information-processing theory; they functionrather as a psychological and phenomenological description of ego-mind (ofego-oriented experience) and as a set of categories to be used in firsthandexamination of that experience of ego-mind. For us, however, the issue is worthpursuing, since concern with the parsing of experience is one of the moreremarkable points of convergence between cognitive science and themindfulness/awareness tradition. To take a sequential view of the aggregatesseems similar to taking a sequential view of brain activity. Form would have tocome first through some preattentive segmentation at the retinal and geniculatelevel, then sensations and perceptions would arise at the reticular andcollicular input, whereas concepts and consciousness would be added atdifferent stages of “higher” brain centers, in areas such as V4, MT, or theinferotemporal cortex. If, however, perceptual activity cannot be so simplyanalyzed into a straightforward sequence, then it becomes difficult to separatethe “low” level of form from the “higher” levels of, say, sensations anddiscernments. The arising of form always involves some predisposition on thepart of our structure. If we take the notion of a heap or pile (skandha) as a metaphor for the emergent configurations of aneural network, we will be led to think of the aggregates as resonant patternsin one moment of emergence. Such resonant patterns do take time to arise, since they involve many cycles of back-and-forthactivity among all participating local networks. In the last chapter wediscussed in some detail how this momentary arising of patterns is perceptuallyand electrically observable in a temporal frame. Furthermore, we also discussedhow, following a certain degree of proficiency in the capacity to observe sucharising, even the finer temporal details are discernible. The “chunkiness” ofsuch transitory configurations seems to be an inevitable consequence of theemergent properties of a network such as the brain. 

It is possible, then, tosee the notion of a heap or pile as a metaphor for what we would now call aself-organizing process. The aggregates would arise as one moment of emergence,as in a resonating network where strictly speaking there is no all-or-noneseparation between simultaneous (since the emergent pattern itself arises as awhole) and sequential (since for the pattern to arise there must be aback-and-forth activity between participating components). Of course, as wesaid above, the aggregates do not constitute an information-processing theory.Nonetheless, the neuropsychological approach that we have just adumbrated seemscompatible with the direct observations based on mindfulness/awarenessmeditation, thus making all the more remarkable the fact that this traditionhas continued to verify the parsing of experience into coherent moments ofemergence. 

## Exeuntthe Symbols 

This alternativeorientation—connectionist, emergent, self-organizational, associationist,network dynamical—is young and diverse. Most of those who would enlistthemselves as members hold widely divergent views on what cognitive science isand on its future. Keeping this disclaimer in mind, we can now present answersto the questions we previously posed to cognitivism from this perspective: 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

The emergence of global states in a network of simple components. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through local rules for individual operation and rules for changes inthe connectivity among the elements. 

 

Question 3: 

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

Answer: 

When the emergent properties (and resulting structure) can be seen tocorrespond to a specific cognitive capacity—a successful solution to a requiredtask. 

One of the most interesting aspects of this alternative approach incognitive science is that symbols, in their conventional sense, play no role.In the connectionist approach, symbolic computations are replaced by numericaloperations—for example, the differential equations that govern a dynamicalsystem. These operations are more fine grained than those performed usingsymbols; in other words, a single, discrete symbolic computation would, in aconnectionist model, be performed as a result of a large number of numericaloperations that govern a network of simple units. In such a system, themeaningful items are not symbols; they are complex patterns of activity amongthe numerous units that make up the network. 

This nonsymbolicapproach involves a radical departure from the basic cognitivist assumptionthat there must be a distinct symbolic level in the explanation of cognition.Cognitivism introduced symbols as a way of bridging the need for a semantic orrepresentational level with the constraint that this level be ultimatelyphysical. Symbols are both meaningful and physical, and a computer is a devicethat respects the meaning of the symbols while operating only on their physicalform. This separation between form and meaning was the masterstroke thatcreated the cognitivist approach—indeed, it was the same one that had createdmodern logic. But this fundamental move also implies a weakness in addressingcognitive phenomena at a deeper level: How do the symbols acquire theirmeaning? 

In situations where theuniverse of possible items to be represented is constrained and clear-cut (forexample, when a computer is programmed or when an experiment is conducted witha set of predefined visual stimuli), the assignment of meaning is clear. Eachdiscrete physical or functional item is made to correspond to an external item(its referential meaning), a mapping operation that the observer easilyprovides. Remove these constraints, and the form of the symbols is all that isleft, and meaning becomes a ghost, as it would if we were to contemplate thebit patterns in a computer whose operating manual had been lost. 

In the connectionistapproach, however, meaning is not located in particular symbols; it is afunction of the global state of the system and is linked to the overallperformance in some domain, such as recognition or learning. Since this globalstate emerges from a network of units that are more fine grained than symbols,some researchers refer to connectionism as the “subsymbolic paradigm.”[24](#24_5) They argue that the formalprinciples of cognition lie in this subsymbolic domain, a domain above butcloser to the biological than to the symbolic level of cognitivism. At thesubsymbolic level, cognitive descriptions are built out of the constituents ofwhat at a higher level would be discrete symbols. Meaning, however, does notreside in these constituents per se; it resides in complex patterns of activitythat emerge from the interactions of many such constituents. 

## LinkingSymbols and Emergence 

This difference betweensubsymbolic and symbolic brings us back to our question about the relationbetween various levels of explanation in the study of cognition. How mightsubsymbolic emergence and symbolic computation be related? 

The most obvious answeris that these two views should be seen as complementary bottom-up and top-downapproaches or that they could be pragmatically joined in some mixed mode orsimply used at different levels or stages. A typical example of this move wouldbe to describe early vision in connectionist terms, up to, say, the primaryvisual cortex. Then, at the level of the inferotemporal cortex, the descriptionwould be based on symbolic programs. The conceptual status of such a synthesis,however, is far from clear, and concrete examples are still lacking. 

In our view, the most interesting relation between subsymbolicemergence and symbolic computation is one of inclusion,in which we see symbols as a higher-level description of properties that areultimately embedded in an underlying distributed system. The case of theso-called genetic code is paradigmatic, and we may use it here for the sake ofa concrete example. 

For many yearsbiologists considered protein sequences as being instructions coded in the DNA.It is clear, however, that DNA triplets are capable of predictably specifyingan aminoacid in a protein if and only if they are embedded in the cell’smetabolism, that is, in the thousands of enzymatic regulations in a complexchemical network. It is only because of the emergent regularities of such anetwork as a whole that we can bracket out this metabolic background and thustreat triplets as codes for aminoacids. In other words, the symbolicdescription is possible at another level. It is clearly possible to treat suchsymbolic regularities in their own right, but their status and interpretationis quite different from when we simply take them at face value, as if they wereindependent of the substratum from which they emerge.[25](#25_5)

The example of geneticinformation can be transposed directly to the cognitive networks with whichneuroscientists and connectionists work. In fact, some researchers haverecently expressed this point of view explicitly.[26](#26_5)In Paul Smolensky’s harmony theory, for example, fragmentary “atoms” ofknowledge about electrical circuits are linked by distributed statisticalalgorithms and so yield a model of intuitive reasoning in this domain. Thecompetence of this whole system can be described as doing inferences based onsymbolic rules, but the performance sits at a different level and is neverachieved by reference to a symbolic interpreter. 

How is this inclusiveview different from the cognitivist conception of levels of explanation? Thedifference is actually rather subtle and is mostly a matter of a shift inperspective. The basic point, agreed to by all, is that to formulateexplanatory generalizations we need the right kind of descriptive vocabulary ortaxonomy. Cognitivism, as we have seen, is founded on the hypothesis that thistaxonomy consists of symbols. This symbolic level constrains the kinds ofbehaviors that are possible for a cognitive system and so is thought to have anindependent, explanatory status. In the inclusive view, the need for a symboliclevel is acknowledged, but the possibility is left open that this level is onlyapproximate. In other words, symbols are not taken at face value; they are seenas approximate macrolevel descriptions of operations whose governing principlesreside at a subsymbolic level. 

Among the many issuesthat change given this possible synthesis, two in particular are worth noting.First, the question of the origin of a symbol and its meaning (why does ATTcode for alanine?) can be approached more clearly. Second, any symbolic levelbecomes highly dependent on the underlying network’s properties andpeculiarities, as well as bound to its history. A purely procedural account ofcognition, independent of its history and the way cognition is embodied, istherefore seriously questioned. 

The cognitivists’ replywill no doubt be that such a mixed or inclusive mode is fine if one isconcerned only with lower-level processes, such as those found in geneticcoding. But when one turns to higher-level processes, such as the ability toparse sentences or make inferences, an independent symbolic level will berequired. In the case of highly recursive structures, such as human language,it will be argued that the symbolic level is not approximate at all; it is theonly precise description available for forms of representation that areproductive and systematic.[27](#27_3) 

There is much to be saidfor this line of argument. The point to be made in reply, though, is that itunjustifiably limits the domain of cognition to very high level processes. Forexample, Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn write in a recent article, “It wouldnot be unreasonable to describe Classical cognitive science [cognitivism] as anextended attempt to apply the methods of proof theory to the modeling ofthought (and similarly, of whatever other mental processes are plausibly viewedas involving inferences; predominantly learning and perception). The point isnot that logical proofs per se are so important inhuman thought, but that the way of dealing with them provides a clue as to howto deal with knowledge-dependent processes in general.”[28](#28_3)Despite this last qualification, however, their argument later in the articleseems to require that deductive logic be the very paradigm of human thought andhence, presumably, of cognition in general. 

We simply see no reasonto give in to this narrow conception of cognition. There are many classes ofsystems, such as the neural networks described in this chapter, whose behaviorshould be seen as cognitive, and yet their abilities do not encompass thesehighly systematic and productive features. In fact, it is even possible toargue that there are nonneural networks that display cognitiveproperties—immune systems, for example.[29](#c5_note_29)When we widen our perspective to include such forms of cognitive behavior,symbolic computation might come to be regarded as only a narrow, highlyspecialized form of cognition. Although it might be possible to treat thisspecialized form as having a high degree of autonomy (by ignoring the largersystem in which it is embedded), the study of cognition would nonethelessinclude systems consisting of many networks of cognitive processes, eachperhaps with its own distinct cognitive domain. 

Cognitivism, perhaps inits desire to establish itself as a mature research program, has resisted sucha perspective. The emergence view, however, both in its early phase of thestudy of self-organizing systems and in its present connectionist form, is opento encompassing a greater variety of cognitive domains. An inclusive or mixedmode seems, therefore, a natural strategy to pursue. A fruitful link between aless orthodox cognitivism and the emergence view, where symbolic regularitiesemerge from parallel distributed processes, is a concrete possibility,especially in AI with its predominantly engineering, pragmatic orientation.This complementary endeavor will undoubtedly produce visible results and mightwell become the dominant trend for many years to come in cognitive science.[30](#30_3) 

We will not discussthese questions further, for they remain open and will be decided largely byfuture research. We wish to raise them simply in the context of our centralquestion: the dialogue between cognitive science and human experience.

# [6 ]()Selfless Minds 

## Societiesof Mind 

We have now seen in somedetail that brains are highly cooperative systems. Nonetheless, they are notuniformly structured networks, for they consist of many networks that arethemselves connected in various ways. As we have already sketched for the caseof the visual system, the entire system resembles a patchwork of subnetworksassembled by a complex process of tinkering, rather than a system that resultsfrom some clean, unified design. This kind of architecture suggests thatinstead of looking for grand, unified models for all network behaviors, oneshould study networks whose abilities are restricted to specific cognitiveactivities and then look for ways to connect the networks. 

This view of cognitivearchitecture has begun to be taken seriously by cognitive scientists in variousways. In this chapter we will see how it also provides a natural entry pointfor the next stage of the dialogue between cognitive science and themindfulness/awareness approach to human experience. To make the discussion clear,we will explore this next stage on the basis of Marvin Minsky’s and SeymourPapert’s recent proposal to study the mind as a society, for this proposaltakes the patchwork architecture of cognition as a central element.[1](#1_13) 

Minsky and Papertpresent a view in which minds consist of many “agents” whose abilities arequite circumscribed: each agent taken individually operates only in amicroworld of small-scale or “toy” problems. The problems must be of a smallscale because they become unmanageable for a single network when they arescaled up.[2](#2_13) This last point has not beenobvious to cognitive scientists. It is to a large extent a result of the manyyears of frustration in AI with attempts to find global solutions (for example,in the form of a General Problem Solver) and of the relative success in findingsolutions to more local tasks—solutions that cannot, however, be extendedbeyond specific domains. The task, then, is to organize the agents who operatein these specific domains into effective larger systems or “agencies,” andthese agencies in turn into higher-level systems. In doing so, mind emerges asa kind of society. 

It is important toremember here that, although inspired by a closer look at the brain, this modelis of the mind. In other words, it is not a model of neural networks orsocieties; it is a model of the cognitive architecture that abstracts fromneurological detail. Agents and agencies are not, therefore, entities ormaterial processes; they are abstract processes or functions. The reader is nodoubt familiar with this theme of various levels by now, but the point bearsemphasizing, especially since Minsky and Papert sometimes write as if they weretalking about cognition at the level of the brain.[3](#3_13)

The model of the mind asa society of numerous agents is intended to encompass a multiplicity ofapproaches to the study of cognition, ranging from distributed, self-organizingnetworks to the classical, cognitivist conception of localized, serial symbolicprocessing. The society of mind purports to be, then, something of a middle wayin present cognitive science. This middle way challenges a homogenous model ofthe mind, whether in the form of distributed networks at one extreme orsymbolic processers at the other extreme. 

This move is particularly apparent when Minsky and Papert argue thatthere are virtues not only to distribution but to insulation, that is, tomechanisms that keep various processes apart.[4](#4_13)The agents within an agency may be connected in the form of a distributednetwork, but if the agencies were themselves connected in the same way, theywould, in effect, constitute one large network whose functions were uniformlydistributed. Such uniformity, however, would restrict the ability to combinethe operations of individual agencies in a productive way. The more distributedthese operations are, the harder it is to have many of them active at the sametime without interfering with one another. These problems do not arise,however, if there are mechanisms to keep various agencies insulated from eachother. These agencies would still interact, but through more limitedconnections, such as those typical of sequential, symbolic processing. 

The details of such aview are, of course, debatable. But the overall picture of mind not as aunified, homogenous entity, nor even as a collection of entities, but rather asa disunified, heterogenous collection of networks of processes seems not onlyattractive but also strongly resonant with the experience accumulated in allthe fields of cognitive science. Such a society can obviously be considered atmore than one level. What counts as an agency, that is, as a collection ofagents, could, if we change our focus, be considered as merely one agent in alarger agency. And conversely, what counts as an agent could, if we resolve ourfocus in greater detail, be seen to be an agency made up of many agents. In thesame way, what counts as a society will depend too on our chosen level offocus. 

Let us take an example.Minsky begins his Society of Mind with the example ofan agent whose specialty is building towers out of toy blocks. But to build atower, one needs to start the tower, add new blocks, and decide when to finish.So this agent—Builder—requires the help of the sub-agents Begin, Add, andFinish, and these sub-agents require still more agents, such as Find and Pickup. The activities of all these agents combine to accomplish the task ofbuilding a tower. If we want to think of Builder as a single agent (ahomunculus, maybe even with a will, who performs actions), then Builder iswhatever it is that switches on all these agents. From the emergent point ofview, however, all of these agents combine to produce Builder as an agency thatconstructs toy towers. 

Minsky’s and Papert’ssociety of mind is not, of course, concerned with the analysis of directexperience. But Minsky draws on a delightfully wide range of human experience,from playing with children’s blocks to being an individual who is aware and canintrospect. In many ways, Minsky’s work is an extended reflection on cognitivescience and human experience, one that is committed to the “subpersonal,” butdoes not wish to lose sight for too long of the personal and experiential. Atcertain points, Minsky even senses the kinship between some of his ideas andthose of the Buddhist tradition, for he begins six of his pages with quotationsfrom the Buddha.[5](#5_13) 

Minsky does not followthe lead that his own citations suggest, however. He argues instead thatalthough there is no room for a truly existing self in cognitive science, wecannot give up our conviction in such a self. At the very end of The Society of Mind, science and human experience simplycome apart. And since we cannot choose between the two, we are ultimately leftwith a condition of schizophrenia, in which we are “condemned” (by ourconstitution) to believe in something we know not to be true (our personalselves). 

Let us emphasize thatthis kind of consequence is not peculiar to Minsky. Indeed, as we saw in ourdiscussion of Jackendoff, cognitivism forces us to separate cognition asrepresentation from cognition as consciousness and in so doing inevitably leadsus to the view that, in Jackendoff’s words, “consciousness is not good foranything.” Thus rather than building a genuine bridge between the computationaland the phenomenological mind, Jackendoff simply reduces the latter to a mere“projection” of the former. And yet, as Jackendoff also notes, “Consciousnessseems too important to one’s life—too much fun—to conceive of it as useless.”[6](#6_13) Thus once again science and humanexperience simply come apart. 

It is only by enlarging the horizon of cognitive science to include anopen-ended analysis of human experience that we will be able to avoid thispredicament. We will return to consider this impasse in its Minskian form ingreater detail. At this point, however, we will turn to a discussion of ideasof society and properties of emergence in two disciplines that examineexperience from perspectives other than cognitive science: we will discusspsychoanalysis briefly and the mindfulness/awareness meditation tradition atgreater length. 

## TheSociety of Object Relations 

Within psychoanalysis, anew school, so different from Freudian theory that it has been called aparadigm shift, has emerged.[7](#7_13) This is objectrelations theory. Freud already anticipated this theory in an embryonicform. For Freud, the superego results from the “internalization” of parentalmorality as an internalized parental figure. Freud also discussed particularpsychological states, such as the mourning process, in terms of relationsbetween the self and such an internalized parent. Object relations theory hasextended this idea to encompass all of psychological development and to act asan explanatory framework for adult functioning. In object relations theory, forexample in the work of Melanie Klein,[8](#8_11)the basic mental developmental process is the internalizing of a rich array ofpersons in various aspects. Fairbairn goes so far as to reconceptualize theconcept of motivation into object relations terms; for Fairbairn the basicmotivating drive of the human is not the pleasure principle but the need toform relationships.[9](#9_13) Horowitz joins object relationstheory to cognitive science by describing internalized object relations asinterpersonal schemas.[10](#c6_note_10) These schemas and subschemas actvery much as Minskian agents. 

The convergence betweenpsychoanalysis, in the form of object relations theory, and the concept of mindas a society in artificial intelligence is striking; Turkle suggests that thisconvergence may be of benefit to both.[11](#11_10)Object relations theory has been much criticized for reifying interdependent,fluid mental processes into an image of independent,static mental structures.[12](#12_8)In the society of mind portrayal of the emergence of agency from agents,however—as in our previous example, Builder—it becomes quite apparent how onecan structure such a conceptual system—how one can incorporate aspects of thedisunity of mind to which object relations theory points—without reification. 

Psychoanalysis is notjust theory but a practice. Troubled patients who see an object relationstherapist learn to explore their minds, behavior, and emotions in terms ofobject relations—they come to see their reactions in terms of internalizedagents. Does this, we wonder, lead them to question their basic sense of selfaltogether? This surely happens in some instances between a gifted therapistand a committed patient. But more generally it is unlikely to happen in thepresent cultural context in Britain and North America since psychoanalysis hasbeen co-opted by psychiatry to an important degree.[13](#13_9)Thus more often than not it is seen as medicine rather than as a means to gainknowledge about the nature of mind. A successful object relations analysis,like any other analysis, is designed to make the patient better—morefunctional, with improved object relations, and with greater emotional comfort;it is not designed to lead him to question, “Isn’t it odd that I am sozealously pursuing my object relations and my comfort when all I am is a set of object relationsschemas? What is going on?” In more general terms, it is apparent that objectrelations analysis, like other contemplative traditions, has discovered thecontradiction between the lack of a self that analysis discovers and ourongoing sense of self. It is not, however, apparent that psychoanalysis in theform of object relations theory has faced, or even fully acknowledged, thiscontradiction. Rather, object relations theory appears to accept the basicmotivation (the basic grasping) of the ongoing sense of self at face value andemploys analytic discoveries about the disunity of the self to cater to thedemands of the ongoing sense of self. Because object relations psychoanalysishas not systematically addressed this basic contradiction—the lack of a unitary self in experience versus the ongoingsense of self-grasping—the open-ended quality that is possible in analysis, thoughpresent in all psychoanalysis and particularly in object relations therapy, islimited. Lacanian analysis in Europe may be one exception, and it may havegained some of its power and notoriety because of this quality.[14](#14_9)A fuller discussion of this fascinating bridge between psychoanalysis andmodern cognitive science—and eventually with the meditation tradition—is,however, beyond the scope of this book. We therefore turn once again tomindfulness/awareness and the expositions of the Abhidharma. 

## CodependentArising 

How is it, if we have noself, that there is coherence in our lives? How is it, if we have no self, thatwe continue to think, feel, and act as though we had a self—endlessly seeking toenhance and defend that nonfindable, nonexperienced self? How and why do themomentary arisings of the elements of experience, the five aggregates andmental factors, follow one another temporally to constitute recurrent patterns?

The Buddha was said tohave discovered on the eve of his enlightenment not only the momentariness ofthe arising of the aggregates but also the entire edifice of causality—thecircular structure of habitual patterns, the binding chain, each link of whichconditions and is conditioned by each of the others—that constitutes thepattern of human life as a never-ending circular quest to anchor experience ina fixed and permanent self. This insight came to be named with the Sanskritword pratityasamutpada, which literally means “dependence(pratitya) upon conditions that are variouslyoriginated (samutpada).” We will use the term codependent arising, since that gloss best expresses theidea, familiar in the context of societies of mind, of transitory yetrecurrent, emergent properties of aggregate elements.[15](#15_8)

This circle is alsocalled the Wheel of Life and the Wheel of Karma. Karma is a topic with a longhistory, both pre- and post-Buddhist, on which an immense amount of scholarshiphas been focused.[16](#16_9) The word karmahas also found its way into contemporary English vocabulary where it isgenerally used as a synonym for fate or predestination. This is definitely not the meaning of karmawithin Buddhism. Karma constitutes a description of psychological causality—ofhow habits form and continue over time. The portrait of the Wheel of Life isintended to show how it is that karmic causality actually works. The emphasison causality is central to the tradition of mindfulness/awareness and as suchis quite compatible with our modern scientific sensibility; in the case ofmindfulness/awareness, however, the concern is with a causal analysis of directexperience, not with causality as an external form of lawfulness. The concernis also pragmatic: How can the understanding of causality be used to break thechains of conditioning mind (an idea quite contrary to the popular notion ofkarma as predestination) and foster mindfulness and insight? 

There are twelve links(called nidanas) in the circular chain (thepatterning situation as shown in [figure 6.1](#fig_001_3)). The circle is an analytic structure thatcan be used to describe events of any duration from a single moment to alifetime or, in the Buddhist view, to many lifetimes. Metaphorically, we couldsay that these motifs have a fractal character: the same patterns seem toappear even when we change the scale of observation by orders of magnitude.Descriptions of the twelve interdependent links follow.

[Figure 6.1](#fig_001a_3) Codependent arisingas the Wheel of Life. 

### 1 Ignorance

Ignorance is the groundof all karmic causal action. It means being ignorant of, not knowing, thetruth(s) about the nature of mind and reality. In the material we havediscussed so far, this means being ignorant—personally experientiallyignorant—of the lack of ego-self. It also means the confusions—the mistakenviews and emotions of believing in a self—that come from that ignorance. Henceit could also be rendered as bewilderment. (In later formulations, it came toinclude other truths about which a sentient being could be ignorant.) 

### 2 VolitionalAction 

Out of ignorance, oneacts on the basis of a self. That is to say, in the selfless state there are noself-oriented intentions. Because of ignorance of the lack of ego-self, theurge toward habitual, repetitive actions based on a self arises. Ignorance andvolitional action are the ground, the prior conditions, sometimes called thepast conditions, that give rise to the next eight links (the third through thetenth). If this analytic scheme is being used to talk about the links arisingin time, then these eight are said to constitute the present situation. 

### 3 Consciousness

Consciousness refers tosentience in general, the dualistic state we talked about as the fifthaggregate. It may mean the beginning of consciousness in the life of anysentient being or the first moment of consciousness in any given situation.Remember that consciousness is not the only mode of knowing; one is born into amoment or a lifetime of consciousness, rather than wisdom, because ofvolitional actions that were based on ignorance. If we are speaking of thearising of a particular moment of consciousness, its precise form (which of thesix sense bases it arises upon, whether it is pleasant, unpleasant, etc.) isconditioned by the seeds laid down by the volitional action(s) of the previouslink. 

### 4 ThePsychophysical Complex 

Consciousness requires abody and mind together. Moments of consciousness in a given situation cangravitate toward one or the other end of the psychophysical complex: perhapsthe consciousness is primarily sensory; perhaps it is primarily mental. 

### 5 TheSix Senses 

A body and mind meanthat one has the six senses. Even brief situations, for example, eating a pieceof fruit—involve moments of each of the six sense consciousnesses: one sees,hears, tastes, smells, touches, and one thinks. 

### 6 Contact

Having the six sensesmeans that each sense is able to contact its sense field, its appropriateobject. Any moment of consciousness involves contact between the sense and itsobject (contact is an omnipresent mental factor—see appendix B); withoutcontact, there is no sense experience. 

### 7 Feeling

Feeling—pleasurable,displeasurable, or neutral—arises from contact. All experience has a feelingtone (feeling is also an omnipresent factor). Feeling has, as its basis, one ofthe six senses. At the point of feeling, one is actually struck by the world—inphenomenological language, one could say that we find ourselves thrown into the world. 

### 8 Craving 

Craving arises from feeling.Although there are innumerable specific kinds of craving (84,000 in onesystem), the basic form of craving is desire for what is pleasurable andaversion for what is displeasurable. Craving is a fundamental, automaticreaction. 

Craving is an extremelyimportant juncture in this chain of causality. Up to this point, the links haverolled off automatically on the basis of past conditioning. At this point,however, the aware person can do something about the situation: he caninterrupt the chain or he can let it go on to the next link (grasping). Thehandling of craving is what determines the possibilities for perpetuation orchange. 

It is a traditionalexercise to contemplate the chain of codependent arising in both directions,backward as well as forward. Because such an exercise communicates well thecodependent emergent quality of this causal analysis, we will show what happenswhen we go backward in our reasoning from the point of craving: craving forpleasure requires that there be sense feelings; to have feelings, there must becontact with the objects of the senses; to contact the sense objects, theremust be the six sense faculties; for the six sense faculties to exist, theentire psychophysical organism is required; for there to be a psychophysicalorganism, there must be sentience. 

### 9 Grasping

Craving usually resultsimmediately in grasping and clinging. Grasping refers not only to graspingafter what one does not have and desires but also to aversion for what one hasand desires to be rid of. 

### 10 Becoming

Grasping automaticallysets off the reaction toward becoming, toward the formation of a new situationin the future. New tendencies and suppositions are formed as a result of thecumulative effect of the previous seven motifs, which themselves were set intomotion by volitional action based on ignorance. Becoming initiates theformation of new patterns that carry over into future situations. 

### 11 Birth

In birth, a newsituation, as well as a new mode of being in that situation, is finally born.It is usually at this point only that one senses the causal chain and wants todo something about it. It is at this point, perhaps, that Western philosopherstalk about akrasia (weakness of the will). The ironyis that in normal life, the point at which one wakes up to a situation is pastthe point where one can do anything about it. Birth into a new situation, evenan agreeable one, always has an edge of uncertainty. 

### 12 Decayand Death 

Wherever there is birth,there is death; in any process of arising, dissolution is inevitable. Momentsdie, situations die, and lives end. Even more obvious than the uneasiness ofbirth is the suffering (and lamentation, as is said) experienced when situationsor bodies grow old, decay, and die. In this circular chain of causality, deathis the causal link to the next cycle of the chain. The death of one moment ofexperience is, within the Buddhist analysis of causality, actually a causalprecondition for the arising of the next moment. If there is still ignoranceand confusion, the wheel will continue turning endlessly in the same fashion. 

The circle of conditioned human existence is called samsara,which is visualized as a perpetually spinning wheel of existence driven by arelentless causation and pervaded by unsatisfactoriness. There are many vividtraditional images for samsara: a ship lost at sea ina raging storm, a deer trapped in a hunter’s net, animals racing before ablazing forest fire. According to one traditional story, the Buddha on the eveof his enlightenment worked through the twelve links of the chain seeking a waythat the chain could be broken. Nothing could be done about the past; onecannot go back and remove past ignorance and volitional actions. And since oneis alive and has a psychophysical organism, the six sense fields and theircontact with objects are inevitable. Inevitable also are the feeling states towhich the senses give rise and the craving that results. But must craving leadto grasping? 

It is at this point,some traditions say, that the Buddha formulated the technique of mindfulness.By precise, disciplined mindfulness to every moment, one can interrupt thechain of automatic conditioning—one can notautomatically go from craving to grasping and all the rest. Interruption ofhabitual patterns results in further mindfulness, eventually allowing thepractitioner to relax into more open possibilities in awareness and to developinsight into the arising and subsiding of experienced phenomena. That is whymindfulness is the foundational gesture of all the Buddhist traditions. 

At this point, we mightreturn briefly to our theoretical formulation. We asked how there could becoherence in our lives over time if there were no self. In the language ofsocieties of mind, the answer lies in the concept of emergence. Just as anyagency emerges from the action of individual agents, so the repetitiouspatterns of habitual actions emerge from the joint action of the twelve links.And just as the existence of the action of each agent is definable only inrelation to the actions of all the others, so the operation of each of thelinks in the chain of codependent arising is dependent on all of the otherlinks. As in any agency, there is no such thing as a habitual pattern per seexcept in the operation of the twelve agent motifs, nor is there such a thingas the motifs except in relation to the operation of the entire cyclic system. 

The historical formationof various patterns and trends in our lives is what Buddhists usually mean by karma. It is this accumulation that gives continuity to thesense of ego-self, so evident in everyday, unreflective life. The mainmotivating and sustaining factor in this process is the omnipresent mentalfactor of intention (see appendix B). Intention—inthe form of volitional action—leaves traces, as it were, of its tendencies onthe rest of the factors from moment to moment, resulting in the historicalaccumulation of habits, tendencies, and responses, some wholesome and othersunwholesome. When the term karma is used loosely, itrefers to these accumulations and their effects. Strictly speaking, though,karma is the very process of intention (volitional action) itself, the maincondition in the accumulation of conditioned human experience. 

In many fields ofscience, we are familiar with the idea that coherence and development over timeneed not involve any underlying substance. In evolutionary changes in thehistory of life, patterns of animal populations give rise to new individuals onthe basis of the past (most tangibly expressed in the nuclear genetics of thepopulation) and on the basis of current actions (mating behavior leading todescendence and genetic recombinations). The tracks and furrows of this processare the species and subspecies. But in the logic of Darwin’s account ofevolution and the Buddhist analysis of experience into codependent arising, weare concerned with the processual transformation of the past into the futurethrough the intermediary of transitional forms that in themselves have nopermanent substance. 

The agent motifs in thechain of conditioned origination are fairly complex processes. Each of thesemay be thought of as composed of sub-agents, or more accurately as themselvesagencies composed of agents. In the mindfulness/awareness tradition, of course,the logic is focused upon immediate experience. Is there an experiential—orpragmatic—justification for increasing the layers of agency in the society ofcausality? 

## Basic Element Analysis 

We have already seen howa moment of consciousness is analyzed into subject, object, and mental factorsthat bind them together. This schematization was present in the earliestAbhidharma but was greatly elaborated in a technique called basic element (dharma) analysis,[17](#17_9)which reached its peak of eloquence in the Abhidharmakosaof Vasubandhu.[18](#18_9) (It is from this work that wehave taken the classification of mental factors presented in appendix B.) 

The term for basicelement in Sanskrit is dharma. Its most generalmeaning in a psychological context is “phenomenon”—not in the Kantian sensewhere phenomena are opposed to noumena but simply in the ordinary sense ofsomething that occurs, arises, or is found in experience. In its more technicalsense, it refers to an ultimate particular, particle, or element that isreached in an analytic examination. In basic element analysis, moments ofexperience (the dharmas) were considered analytically irreducible units; theywere, in fact, called ultimate realities, whereas the coherences of daily lifethat were composed of these elements—a person, a house—were called conventionalrealities. 

This idea thatexperience, or what the phenomenologist would call the life-world, can beanalyzed into a more fundamental set of constituents was also a central elementin Husserl’s phenomenological project. This project broke down because it was,among other things, purely abstract and theoretical. Basic element analysis, onthe other hand, was much more successful because it was generated from anopen-ended, embodied reflection: it arose as a way of codifying andinterpreting the results of the mindfulness/awareness examination ofexperience. Therefore, even when basic element analysis received certain kindsof devastating criticism from philosophers such as Nagarjuna, it couldnonetheless survive as a valuable practice, though seen in a different light. 

On a more theoreticallevel, philosophers might recognize some parallels between basic elementanalysis and the analytic, rationalist tradition in the West as exemplified byLeibniz, Frege, Russell, and the early Wittgenstein. In both traditions thereis a concern with analyzing complex aggregates of societies—whether these bethings in the world, linguistic or logical descriptions, mentalrepresentations, or direct experience—into their simple and ultimate constituents.Minsky, for example, upholds this analytic tradition when he writes that his“agents of the mind could be the long-sought ‘particles’ that … theories [ofmind] need.”[19](#19_9) Such reductionism is almostalways accompanied by realism: one adopts a realist stance toward whatever oneclaims as one’s privileged basis, one’s ultimate ground. 

Here, however, we comeupon an interesting difference between Western rationalism and the rationalismembodied in the Abhidharma. In the latter, the designation of basic elements asultimate reality, we are told, was not an assertion that the basic elementswere ontological entities in the sense of being substantially existent.[20](#20_9) Surely this is an interestingcase study—we have here a philosophical system, a reductive system, in whichreductive basic elements are postulated as ultimate realities but in whichthose ultimate realities are not given ontological status in the usual sense.How can that be? Emergents, of course, do not have the status of ontologicalentities (substances). Might we have a system here in which the basic elementsare themselves emergents? 

This question is all themore interesting because basic element analysis was not simply an abstract,theoretical exercise. It had both a descriptive and a pragmatic motivation. Theconcern of the meditator is to break the wheel of conditioned origination andbecome aware, wise, and free. She is told that she canactually experientially catch herself (within this emergent society of thewheel of the twelve links) at the moment of craving and can begin to undo herconditioning. Will a basic element analysis provide clarity that will help inthis task? 

We may remember that inbasic element analysis each element, each moment of consciousness, consists ofthe consciousness itself (called, in this system, the primary mind) and itsmental factors. The (momentary) mental factors are what bind the (momentary)object (which is, of course, always in one of the six sense fields). Thespecific quality of each moment of consciousness and its karmic effects onfuture moments depend upon which mental factors are present. 

The relationship betweenconsciousness and the mental factors seems remarkably similar to the relationbetween Minskian agencies and agents. The contemporary Tibetan scholar GesheRabten puts it thus: “The term ‘primary mind’ denotes the totality of a sensoryor mental state composed of a variety of mental factors. A primary mind is likea hand whereas the mental factors are like the individual fingers, the palm,and so forth. The character of a primary mind is thus determined by itsconstituent mental factors.”[21](#21_9) A hand is an agency of which thefingers, palm, etc., are agents; it is also an agent of the body. These aredifferent levels of description; neither agent nor agency would exist withoutthe other. Like the hand, we could call the primary mind an emergent. 

We would do well to lookonce again at the five omnipresent mental factors: contact, feeling,discernment, intention, and attention. 

### 1 Contact

Contact is a form ofrapport between the senses and their objects, a matching of sensitivity betweena sense and an object in the sense field. It is a relational property involvingthree terms: one of the six senses, a material or mental object, and theconsciousness based upon these two. There is evidence to suggest that thissensitivity was conceived as a dynamic process giving rise to emergence: theevidence is that contact, as a process, is described as being both a cause andan effect. As a cause, contact is the coming together of three distinct items—asense, an object, and the potential for awareness. As an effect, contact isthat which results from this process of coming together—a condition of harmonyor rapport among the three items. This rapport is not the property of either asense, an object, or an awareness per se. It is a property of the processes bywhich they interact, in other words, an emergent property. Because of one’sconditioning, one thinks that contact—sense organ, sense field, and senseconsciousness—implies a self; in this analysis it may be seen in a neutral,“scientific” light as an emergence. 

This conception ofcontact strikes us as quite remarkable. It could be applied almostword-for-word to our discussion of vision as a unitary phenomenon. In a culturethat did not have access to scientific notions of circular causality, feedback/feedforward,and emergent properties, nor to logical formalisms for handling self-reference,the only recourse for expressing an emergent may have been to say that aprocess is both cause and effect. Early Buddhism developed the idea of anemergent both at the (relatively) global level of codependent origination andthe (relatively) local level of contact; this development was of centralimportance to the analysis of the arising of experience without a self. Thissuggests that our current formulations of emergence are not simply logicaltricks soon to be replaced by some other way of conceptualizing phenomena;rather, our modern forms may be the rediscovery of a basic aspect of humanexperience. 

### 2 Feeling 

We have alreadydiscussed feeling as the second aggregate and the seventh link in the circle ofcodependent arising. Normally feelings lead instantly to reactions thatperpetuate karmic conditioning. Bare feelings, however, are neutral; it isone’s response that is, in the language of mental factor analysis, eitherwholesome or unwholesome. Normally we never actually experience our feelingsbecause the mind jumps so quickly to the reaction. Even a neutral feeling(often even more threatening to the sense of self than a displeasurable feelingbecause a neutral feeling seems less self-relevant) leads quickly to boredomand to the finding of any possible physical or mental occupation. Meditatorsoften report that they discover for the first time, in mindfulness practice,what it is like actually to experience a feeling. 

### 3 Discernment

Perception(discernment)/impulse was discussed as the third aggregate. It normally arisesinseparably with feeling. Through mindfulness, however, the meditator mayrecognize impulses of passion, aggression, and ignoring for what theyare—impulses that need not automatically lead to action. In terms of mentalfactor analysis, one may thus be able to choose wholesome rather thanunwholesome actions. (Eventually, when sufficient freedom from habitualpatterns has been obtained, perception/discernments can—according to some laterformulations—automatically give rise not to self-based impulses of passion,aggression, and ignoring but to impulses of wisdom and compassionate action.) 

### 4 Intention

Intention is anextremely important process, which functions to arouse and sustain theactivities of consciousness (with its mental factors) from moment to moment.Intention is the manner in which the tendency to volitional action (the secondlink) manifests itself in the mind at any given moment. There are no volitionalactions without intention. Thus, karma is sometimes said to be the process ofintention itself—that which leaves traces on which future habits will be based.Normally we act so rapidly and compulsively that we do not see intentions. Someschools of mindfulness training encourage meditators to spend periods of timein which they slow down activities so that they may become aware of theintentions that precede even very trivial volitional actions such as changingposition when one becomes uncomfortable. Awareness of intention is thus adirect aid to cutting the chain of conditioned orgination at the craving link. 

### 5 Attention

Attention, the finalfactor of the five omnipresent mental factors, arises in interaction withintention. Intention directs consciousness and the other mental factors towardsome general area, at which point attention moves them toward specificfeatures. (Remember the interaction of agents in Minsky’s description of theagency Builder.) Attention focuses and holds consciousness on some object. Whenaccompanied by apperception, attention serves as the basis for theobject-ascertaining factors (see appendix B) of recollection and mindfulness,as well as the positive mental factor of alertness. 

These five factors, whenjoined with various of the object-ascertaining and variable factors (listed inappendix B), produce the character of each moment of consciousness. The mentalfactors present at a given moment interact with each other such that thequality of each factor as well as the resultant consciousness is an emergent. 

Ego-self, then, is the historical pattern among moment-to-momentemergent formations. To make use of a scientific metaphor, we could say thatsuch traces (karma) are one’s experiential ontogeny (including but notrestricted to learning). Here ontogeny is understood not as a series oftransitions from one state to another but as a process of becoming that isconditioned by past structures, while maintaining structural integrity frommoment to moment. On an even larger scale, karma also expresses phylogeny, forit conditions experience through the accumulated and collective history of ourspecies. 

The precise nature ofthe lists and definitions of mental factors should not be taken toocompulsively. Different schools produced different lists of factors. Differentschools also disagreed (and disagree to this day) about how important it is forpractitioners to study such lists (they were traditionally burned in Zen),about the stage of development at which the individual should study theAbhidharma in general and such lists in particular (given that he should studythem at all) and about whether and how such lists should be used in meditativecontemplation. All schools of mindfulness/awareness meditation, however, agreethat intense mindfulness of what arises from moment to moment in the mind isnecessary if one is to start to undo karmic conditioning. 

We have achieved twomain goals by this analysis: First, we have seen how both a single moment ofconsciousness and the causal coherence of moments of consciousness over timecan be formulated in the language of emergence without the postulation of aself or any other ontological entity. Second, we have seen how suchformulations can be both experientially descriptive and pragmatically oriented.This latter point bears further discussion since the notion of pragmatics maytake an unfamiliar cast in a system that aims to undercut volitional(egocentric) action. 

## Mindfulnessand Freedom 

We have been speakingthroughout of a mindful, open-ended analysis of experience, an analysis thatincludes changes in the mind of the analyzers as they proceed in the analysis.Through mindfulness, the mindfulness/awareness practitioners can begin to interruptautomatic patterns of conditioned behavior (specifically, they can let go ofautomatic grasping when craving arises). This, in turn, leads to an increase inthe ability to be mindful and an eventual expansion of the field of attentioninto awareness that begins to penetrate the root ignorance. This awarenessleads to further insight into the nature of experience, which fosters furtherdesire and ability to give up the whole cycle of blind, habitual patterns basedon ignorance and egocentric volitional action. 

People often worry thatwere they to loosen their hold on craving and grasping, their desire would goaway, and they would become numb and catatonic. In fact, exactly the reverse isthe case. It is the mindless, the unaware, state of mind that is numb—swathedin a thick cocoon of wandering thoughts, prejudgments, and solipsisticruminations. As mindfulness grows, appreciation for the components ofexperience grows. The point of mindfulness/awareness is not to disengage themind from the phenomenal world; it is to enable the mind to be fully present inthe world. The goal is not to avoid action but to be fully present in one’sactions, so that one’s behavior becomes progressively more responsive andaware. 

In modern society,freedom is generally thought of as the ability to do whatever one wants. Theview of codependent origination is radically different. (One contemporaryBuddhist teacher even titled a book The Myth of Freedom.[22](#22_9)) Doing whatever one wants out ofa sense of ego (volitional action), according to this system, is the least freeof actions; it is chained to the past by cycles of conditioning, and it resultsin further enslavement to habitual patterns in the future. To be progressivelymore free is to be sensitive to the conditions and genuine possibilities ofsome present situation and to be able to act in anopen manner that is not conditioned by grasping and egoistic volitions. Thisopenness and sensitivity encompasses not only one’s own immediate sphere ofperceptions; it also enables one to appreciate others and to developcompassionate insight into their predicaments. The repeated glimpses reportedby practitioners of this openness and genuineness in human life explain thevitality of the mindfulness/awareness tradition. It also illustrates how a richtheoretical tradition can be naturally interwoven with human concerns. 

## SelflessMinds; Divided Agents 

From a contemporarystandpoint, then, Abhidharma appears as the study of the emergent formation ofdirect experience without the ground of an ego-self. It is remarkable how wellthe overall logical form of some Abhidharma formulations fits that ofcontemporary scientific concern with emergent properties and societies of mind.(Or perhaps we should state it the other way round.) These latter contemporaryscientific concerns have, however, been pursued independently of anydisciplined analysis and direct examination of human experience. Since thereader may still be skeptical that science and human experience are inseparablepartners, we will now turn to consider in more detail what happens when thispartnership is one-sided. What happens when the insight that mind is free ofself is generated from within the very heart of science and yet is notconnected to the rest of human experience? 

We have seen how a viewof selfless minds begins to take form with the cognitivist separation ofconsciousness and intentionality. We then saw how cognition can be studied asan emergent phenomenon in self-organizing, distributed networks. In thischapter, we have seen the usefulness of a mixed, “society” mode of descriptionfor cognitive processes and human experience. Of what use, then, is the idea ofa central agent or self? 

Most working cognitivescientists, and even some cognitivist philosophers, are content to ignore thisquestion. One of the virtues of both Minsky’s Society ofMind and Jackendoff’s Consciousness and theComputational Mind is that each recognizes this question quite early onand takes it as a central theme. Minsky in particular distinguishes between thelowercase self, which refers “in a general sense toan entire person,” and the uppercase Self, whichrefers to “that more mysterious sense of personal identity.” He then asks, “Isthis concept of a Self of any real use at all?” And he answers, “It isindeed—provided that we think of it not as a centralized and all-powerfulentity, but as a society of ideas that include both our images of what the mindis and our ideals about what it ought to be.”[23](#23_8)

The distinctions thatMinsky draws in these remarks are suggestive, especially in the context of ourdiscussion. They are close to the Buddhist distinction between the coherentpattern of dependently originated habits that we recognize as a person and theego-self that a person may believe she has and constantly grasps after butwhich does not actually exist. That is, the word selfis a convenient way of referring to a series of mental and bodily events andformations, that have a degree of causal coherence and integrity through time.And the capitalized Self does exemplify our sensethat hidden in these transitory formations is a real, unchanging essence thatis the source of our identity and that we must protect. But as we have seen,this latter conviction may be unfounded and, as Minsky insightfully notes, canactually be harmful. 

But equally interestingare the ways in which Minsky’s distinctions—or those of other cognitivescientists concerned with the same issue, such as Jackendoff—do not match thoseof the Buddhist tradition. We believe that the lack of fit is ultimately rootedin two related issues. First, contemporary cognitive science does notdistinguish between the idea or representation of a Self and the actual basisof that representation, which is an individual’s grasping after an ego-self.Cognitive science has challenged the idea that thereis a real thing to which the fomer applies, but it has not even thought toconsider the latter. Second, cognitive science does not yet take seriously itsown findings of the lack of a Self. 

Both of these stem fromthe lack of a disciplined method for examination and inclusion of humanexperience in cognitive science. The major result of this lack is the issuethat has been with us since the beginning: cognitive science offers us a purelytheoretical discovery, which remains remote from actual human experience, ofmind without self. 

For example Minsky, onthe same page from which the previous quotations were taken, writes that“perhaps it’s because there are no persons in ourheads to make us do the things we want—nor even ones to make us want to want—that we construct the myth that we’re inside ourselves.” This remark confuses two featuresof mind without self that we have repeatedly seen to be distinct: one is thelack of an ego-self and the other is grasping for an ego-self. We construct thebelief or inner discourse that there is an ego-self not because the mind isultimately empty of such a self but because the everyday conditioned mind isfull of grasping. Or to make the point in the vocabulary ofmindfulness/awareness, the belief is rooted in the accumulated tendencies thatfrom moment to moment give rise to the unwholesome mental factors thatreinforce grasping and craving. It is not the lack of an ego-self per se thatis the source of this ongoing belief and private internal conversation; it isthe emotional response to that lack. Since we habitually assume that there isan ego-self, our immediate response is to feel a loss when we cannotinferentially find the object of our convictions. We feel as if we have lostsomething precious and familiar, and so we immediately try to fill that losswith the belief in a self. But how can we lose something that we (that is, ourtemporary, emergent “wes”) never had? And if we never had an ego-self in thefirst place, what is the point of continually trying to maintain one by tellingourselves we’re inside ourselves? If it is to ourselves that we are talking inthis conversation, why should we need to tell ourselves all of this in thefirst place? 

This feeling of loss,though somewhat natural when one’s investigation is still at an inferentialstage, is heightened and prolonged when the discovery of the lack of selfremains purely theoretical. In the tradition of a mindful, open-endedexamination of experience, the initial conceptual realization of mind withoutself is deepened to the point where it is realized in a direct, personal way.The realization shifts from being merely inferential to being direct experiencethrough a journey where the actual practice of mindfulness/awareness plays acentral role. And as a form of direct experience, generations of meditatorsattest that the lack of an ego-self does not continue to be experienced as aloss that needs to be supplemented by a new belief or inner dialogue. On thecontrary, it is the beginning of a feeling of freedom from fixed beliefs, forit makes apparent precisely the openness and space in which a transformation ofwhat the subject itself is, or could be, becomes possible. 

Minsky suggests,however, that we embrace the idea of Self because “so much of what our minds dois hidden from the parts of us that are involved with verbal consciousness.”[24](#24_7) Similarly, Jackendoff suggeststhat “awareness reflects a curious amalgam of the effects on the mind of boththought and the real world, while leaving totally opaque the means by whichthese effects come about.”[25](#25_7) There are two problems with thisposition. In the first place, the hypothesized mental processes of which we areunaware are just that—processes hypothesized by the cognitivistinformation-processing model of the mind. It is this model that requires a hostof subpersonal hidden processes and activities, not our experiences of the minditself. But surely it is not these ever-changing phantoms of cognitive sciencethat we can blame for our belief that we personally have an ego-self; to thinkso would be a confusion of levels of discourse. In the second place, even if wedid have many mental activities at the subpersonal level inherently hidden fromawareness, how would that explain our belief in an ego-self? A glance at thecomplexity of Jackendoff’s and Minsky’s models of the mind suggests that were amind actually to have all of these mechanisms, awareness of them would notnecessarily even be desirable. Lack of awareness is not in itself a problem.What is a problem is the lack of discrimination and mindfulness of the habitualtendency to grasp, of which we can become aware. This type of mindfulness can be developed with great precision due tothe fundamentally discontinuous—and hence unsolid—nature of our experience. (Wehave seen how some of this discontinuity and lack of solidity is quiteconsonant with modern cognitive science, and we are now even able to observesome of it from a neurophysiological standpoint.) The cultivation of suchprecision is possible not just in formal periods of practice but in oureveryday lives. An entire tradition with numerous cultural variants andaccessible methods testifies to the possibility and actuality of this humanjourney of investigation and experience. 

As we can see from ourdiscussion of both Minsky and Jackendoff, cognitive science basically ignoresthis possibility. This indifferent attitude generates two significant problems.First, by means of this ignoring, cognitive science denies itself theinvestigation of an entire domain of human experience. Even though the“plasticity” of experience, especially in its perceptual forms, has becomesomething of a topic of debate among philosophers and cognitive scientists,[26](#26_7) no one is investigating the waysin which conscious awareness can be transformed as a result of practices suchas mindfulness/awareness. In the mindfulness/awareness tradition, in contrast,the possibility of such transformation is the cornerstone of the entire studyof mind.[27](#27_5) 

The second problem isthe one we have evoked from the very beginning of this book: science becomesremote from human experience and, in the case of cognitive science, generates adivided stance in which we are led to affirm consequences that we appear to beconstitutionally incapable of accepting. Explicit attempts to heal this gap arebroached only by a few, such as Gordon Globus, who asks the question, What is aneural network that it may be capable of supporting a Dasein,an embodied existence?[28](#28_5) or Sherry Turkle, who hasexplored a possible bridge between cognitive science and psychoanalysis.[29](#29_4) And yet, to the extent thatresearch in cognitive science requires more and more that we revise our naiveidea of what a cognizing subject is (its lack of solidity, its divideddynamics, and its generation from unconscious processes), the need for a bridgebetween cognitive science and an open-ended pragmatic approach to humanexperience will become only more inevitable. Indeed, cognitive science will beable to resist the need for such a bridge only by adopting an attitude that isinconsistent with its own theories and discoveries. 

The deep problem, then,with the merely theoretical discovery of mind without self in as powerful andtechnical a context as late-twentieth-century science is that it is almostimpossible to avoid embracing some form of nihilism. If science continues tomanipulate things without embracing a progressive appreciation of how we liveamong those things, then the discovery of mind without self will have no lifeoutside the laboratory, despite the fact that the mind in that laboratory isthe very same mind without self. This mind discovers its own lack of a personalground—a deep and remarkable discovery—and yet has no means to embody thatrealization. Without such embodiment, we have little choice but to deny theself altogether, without giving up for one moment our habitual craving for whathas just been denied us. 

By nihilismwe mean to refer precisely to Nietzsche’s definition: “Radicalnihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence whenit comes to the highest values that one recognizes.”[30](#30_5)In other words, the nihilistic predicament is the situation in which we knowthat our most cherished values are untenable, and yet we seem incapable ofgiving them up. 

This nihilisticpredicament emerges quite clearly in both Jackendoff’s and Minsky’s books. Aswe mentioned, Jackendoff claims, on the one hand, that “consciousness is notgood for anything,” and then, on the other hand, that consciousness is “tooimportant for one’s life—too much fun—to conceive of it as useless.” Thus forJackendoff belief in the causal efficacy of consciousness is untenable, and yethe—like the rest of us—is incapable of giving it up. 

A similar predicamentemerges at the end of Minsky’s book. On the last pages of his Society of Mind, Minsky examinesthe notion of free will, which he calls “the myth of the third alternative”between determinism and chance. Science tells us that all processes aredetermined or depend in part on chance. There is no room, therefore, for somemysterious third possibility called a “free will,” by which Minsky means “anEgo, Self, or Final Center of Control, from which we choose what we shall do atevery fork in the road of time.” 

What, then, is Minsky’sresponse to this predicament? The final paragraph of his second-to-last page isworth quoting in full: 

No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of thewill: that concept is essential to our model of the mental realm. Too much ofour psychology is based on it for us to ever give it up. We’re virtually forcedto maintain that belief, even though we know it’s false—except, of course whenwe’re inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs,whatever may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace. 

At the moment, it is thefeeling tone of Minsky’s dilemma that concerns us. Although he ends The Society of Mind a page later with the more upbeatthought that “whenever anything goes wrong there are always other realms ofthought,” the quotation on free will is actually his final vision of therelation between science and human experience. As with Jackendoff, science andhuman experience come apart, and there is no way to put them together again.Such a situation exemplifies perfectly Nietzsche’s hundred-year-old diagnosisof our cultural predicament. (The remark of Nietzsche’s we quoted is dated1887.) We are forced—condemned—to believe in something we know can’t be true. 

We are going to suchgreat lengths to discuss both Minsky’s and Jacken­doff’s work because each clearlypresents, in its own way, the predicament we all face. Indeed, Minsky andJackendoff have done us the great service of not shying away from thesituation, as do other scientists and philosophers who imagine that there aresecret recesses within the brain that hide an existing self[31](#c6_note_31)or who suppose that probability and uncertainty at the quantum level provide ahome for free will.[32](#32_3) 

Nevertheless, the issuesas discussed by Minsky and Jackendoff are rather starkly met. Both are sayingthat there is an unbridgeable contradiction between cognitive science and humanexperience. Cognitive science tells us that we do not have a Self that isefficacious and free. We cannot, however, give up such a belief—we are“virtually forced” to maintain it. The mindfulness/awareness tradition, on theother hand, says that we are most certainly notforced to maintain it. This tradition offers a fourth alternative, a vision offreedom of action that is radically different from our usual conceptions offreedom. 

Let us be clear thatthis is not an issue in the philosophy of free will. (We are resisting, withgreat effort, the urge to launch into a discussion of physical versusstructural determinism, prediction, and many other philosophical reactions toMinsky’s and Jackendoff’s claims.) What is at issue is that there is atradition the very heart of which is to examine such issues in experience.Virtually the entire Buddhist path has to do with going beyond emotionalgrasping to ego. Meditative techniques, traditions of study and contemplation,social action, and the organization of entire communities have been harnessedtoward this end. Histories, psychologies, and sociologies have been (and canbe) written about it. As we have described several times, human beings dotransform themselves (and they certainly do believe that they can transformthemselves) progressively in this way. The result, in this world view, is thatreal freedom comes not from the decisions of an ego-self’s “will” but fromaction without any Self whatsoever. 

What cognitive scienceis saying about selfless minds is important for human experience. Cognitivescience speaks with authority in modern society. Yet there is the danger thatcognitive scientists will follow Hume’s example: having brilliantly formulatedthe discovery of selfless minds, a discovery of fundamental relevance to thehuman situation, but conceiving of no way to bring that discovery together with everyday experience, they will have norecourse but to shrug and go off to any modern equivalent of backgammon. Wehave been attempting to offer instead a bridge back to human experience. 

## Mindingthe World 

We have spent the firstthree parts of this book looking for the self, but even when we could not findit, we never doubted the stability of the world. How could we, when it seemedto provide the setting for all of our examinations? And yet when, having discoveredthe groundlessness of the self, we turn toward the world, we are no longer surewe can find it. Or perhaps we should say that once we let go of a fixed self,we no longer know how to look for the world. We define the world, after all, asthat which is not-self, that which is different from the self, but how can wedo this when we no longer have a self as a reference point? 

Once more, we seem to belosing our grip on something familiar. Indeed, at this point most people willprobably become quite nervous and see the specters of solipsism, subjectivism,and idealism lurking on the horizon, even though we already know that we cannotfind a self to serve as the anchor point for such literally self-centeredviews. We are, perhaps, more attached to the idea that the world has a fixedand ultimate ground than we are to the idea of a personal self. We need, then,to pause and become fully aware of this anxiety that lies underneath thevarieties of cognitive and emergent realism. This task takes us to the nextstep of our journey.

# [7 ]()The Cartesian Anxiety 

## A Sense of Dissatisfaction 

Why should it bethreatening to question the idea that the world has pregiven properties that werepresent? Why do we become nervous when we call into question the idea thatthere is some way that the world is “out there,” independent of our cognition,and that cognition is a re-presentation of that independent world? 

Our spontaneous andunreflective common sense would deny that these questions are scientific,perhaps by thinking, “How else could the mind and theworld be related?” The realist in us claims that our questions are simply“philosophical”—a polite way of making them seem interesting, yet alsoirrelevant. It is true that they are partly philosophical, but we can alsorephrase them as questions in cognitive science. What actually is thescientific basis for the idea that the mind is some kind ofinformation-processing device that responds selectively to pregiven features ofthe environment? Why do we assume that cognitive science cannot call intoquestion these notions of representation and information processing not justphilosophically but in its day-to-day research? 

To think that we cannotraise such issues is a blindness in contemporary common sense, deeplyentrenched in our Western tradition and recently reinforced by cognitivism.Thus even when the very ideas of representation and information processingchange considerably, as they do in the study of connectionist networks,self-organization, and emergent properties, some form of the realist assumptionremains. In cognitivism, the realism is at least explicit and defended; in theemergence approach, however, it often becomes simply tacit and unquestioned.This unreflective stance is one of the greatest dangers facing the field ofcognitive science; it limits the range of theories and ideas and so prevents abroader vision and future for the field. 

A growing number ofresearchers in all areas of cognitive science have expressed dissatisfactionwith the varieties of cognitive realism. This dissatisfaction derives from adeeper source than the search for alternatives to symbol processing or evenmixed “society of mind” theories: it is a dissatisfaction with the very notionof a representational system. This notion obscures many essential dimensions ofcognition not just in human experience but when we try to explain cognitionscientifically. These dimensions include the understanding of perception andlanguage, as well as the study of evolution and life itself. 

Our discussion so farhas focused on linking the two poles of science and human experience. Part IVwill continue this task, but by developing a nonrepresentationist alternativefrom within the heart of cognitive science. We now need to pause and reflect onthe scientific and philosophical roots of the very idea of representation. Weare thinking not merely of the current notions in cognitive science ofcomputation and information processing but of the entire philosophical tendencyto view the mind as a “mirror of nature.”[1](#1_15)

## Representation Revisited 

In the discussion ofcognitivism we distinguished between two senses of representation, which we nowneed to recall. On the one hand, there is the relatively uncontroversial notionof representation as construal: cognition always consists in construing orrepresenting the world a certain way. On the other hand, there is the muchstronger notion that this feature of cognition is to be explained by thehypothesis that a system acts on the basis of internal representations. Sinceit might seem that these two ideas amount to the same thing, we need to refineour distinction somewhat. 

We can begin by noting arelatively weak and uncontroversial sense of representation. This sense ispurely semantic: It refers to anything that can be interpreted as being aboutsomething. This is the sense of representation as construal, since nothing isabout something else without construing it as being some way. A map, forexample, is about some geographical area; it represents certain features of theterrain and so construes that terrain as being a certain way. Similarly, wordson a page represent sentences in a language, which may in turn represent or beabout still other things. This sense of representation can be made even moreprecise. If, for example, our concern happens to be with languages in a moreformal setting, we can say that the statements of a language represent theirconditions of satisfaction. For example, the statement “snow is white”—takenliterally—is satisfied if snow is white; the statement “pick up yourshoes”—again, taken literally—is satisfied if the shoes are picked up by theperson being addressed.[2](#2_15) 

This sense ofrepresentation is weak because it need not carry any strong epistemological orontological commitments. Thus it is perfectly acceptable to speak of a maprepresenting the terrain without worrying about such things as how maps gettheir meaning. It is also perfectly acceptable to think of a statement asrepresenting some set of conditions without making further assumptions aboutwhether language as a whole works this way or whether there really are facts inthe world separate from language that can then be re-presented by the sentencesof the language. Or we can even talk about experiential representations, suchas the image I have of my brother, without making any further assumptions abouthow this image arose in the first place. In other words, this weak sense ofrepresentation is pragmatic; we use it all the time without worry. 

The obviousness of suchan idea, however, is quickly transformed into a much stronger sense ofrepresentation that does carry quite heavy ontological and epistemologicalcommitments. This strong sense arises when we generalize on the basis of theweaker idea to construct a full-fledged theory of how perception, language, orcognition in general must work. The ontological and epistemological commitmentsare basically twofold: We assume that the world is pregiven, that its featurescan be specified prior to any cognitive activity. Then to explain the relationbetween this cognitive activity and a pregiven world, we hypothesize theexistence of mental representations inside the cognitive system (whether thesebe images, symbols, or subsymbolic patterns of activity distributed across anetwork does not matter for the moment). We then have a full-fledged theorythat says (1) the world is pregiven; (2) our cognition is of this world—even ifonly to a partial extent, and (3) the way in which we cognize this pregivenworld is to represent its features and then act on the basis of theserepresentations. 

We must, then, return toour earlier metaphor, the idea of a cognitive agent that is parachuted into apregiven world. This agent will survive only to the extent that it is endowedwith a map and learns to act on the basis of this map. In the cognitivistversion of this story, the map is an innately specified system of representations—sometimescalled a “language of thought”—whereas learning to employ this map is the taskof ontogeny. 

Many cognitive scientists will object that we have presented acaricature. Are we not presupposing a static conception of representation, one thatoverlooks the rich detail of the inner structure of a cognitive system andunjustifiably construes a representation as merely a mirror? Is it not wellknown, for example, that visual perception is considered to be a result ofmapping the physical patterns of energy that stimulate the retina intorepresentations of the visual scene, which are then used to make inferences andeventually to produce a perceptual judgment? Perception is seen as an activeprocess of hypothesis formation, not as the simple mirroring of a pregivenenvironment. 

This objection, thoughsomewhat fair, misses the point. Our point is not to caricature a sophisticatedresearch program but simply to render explicit some tacit epistemologicalassumptions in as clear a fashion as possible. Thus although everyone agreesthat representation is a complex process, it is nonetheless conceived to be oneof recovering or reconstructing extrinsic, independent environmental features.Thus in vision research, for example, one speaks of “recovering shape fromshading” or “color from brightness.” Here the latter features are considered tobe extrinsic properties of the environment that provide the information neededto recover “higher-order” properties of the visual scene, such as shape andcolor. The basic idea of a world with pregiven features remains.[3](#3_15)

The complaint that wehave presented a caricature would, however, be justified were we not toacknowledge the subtlety and sophistication of cognitive realism in relation tothe classical opposition between realism and idealism in philosophy. In thehands of cognitive realism, the notion of representation does undergo somethingof a mutation. The power of this mutation is that it seems to offer a way outof the classical opposition between realism and idealism. 

This opposition is basedin the traditional notion of representation as a “veil of ideas” that standsbetween us and the world. On the one hand, the realist naturally thinks thatthere is a distinction between our ideas or concepts and that which theyrepresent, namely, the world. The ultimate court of appeal for judging thevalidity of our representations is this independent world. Of course, each ofour representations must cohere with many others, but the point of suchinternal features is to increase the probability that globally ourrepresentations will have some measure of correspondence or degree of fit withan outer and independent world. 

The idealist, on theother hand, quickly points out that we have no access to such an independentworld except through our representations. We cannot stand outside of ourselvesto behold the degree of fit that our representations might have with the world.In fact, we simply have no idea of what the outside world is except that it isthe presumed object of our representations. Taking this point to the extreme,the idealist argues that the very idea of a world independent ofrepresentations is itself only another of our representations—a second-order ormetarepresentation. Our sense of an outer ground thus slips away, and we areleft grasping for our internal representations, as if these could provide asure and stable reference point. 

At first sight,contemporary cognitive science seems to offer a way out of this traditionalphilosophical impasse. Largely because of cognitive science, philosophicaldiscussion has shifted from concern with a priori representations(representations that might provide some noncontingent foundation for ourknowledge of the world) to concern with a posteriori representations(representations whose contents are ultimately derived from causal interactionswith the environment). This naturalized conception of representation does notinvite the skeptical questions that motivate traditional epistemology. In fact,to shift one’s concern to organism-environment relations in this way is largelyto abandon the task of traditional a priori epistemology in favor of thenaturalized projects of psychology and cognitive science.[4](#4_15)By taking up such a naturalized stance, cognitive science avoids the antinomiesthat lurk in transcendental or metaphysical realism, without embracing thesolipsism or subjectivism that constantly threatensidealism. The cognitive scientist is thus able to remain a staunch realistabout the empirical world while making the details of mind and cognition thesubject of his investigations. 

Cognitive science thusseems to provide a way of talking about representation without being burdenedby the traditional philosophical image of the mind as a mirror of nature. Butthis appearance is misleading. It is true, as Richard Rorty remarks, that thereis no way to raise the traditional skeptical questions of epistemology incognitive science. Global skepticism about the possibility of cognition orknowledge is simply not to the point in the practice of science. But it doesnot follow, as Rorty seems to think, that the current naturalized conception ofrepresentation has nothing to do with the traditional image of the mind as amirror of nature.[5](#5_15) On the contrary, a crucial featureof this image remains alive in contemporary cognitive science—the idea of aworld or environment with extrinsic, pregiven features that are recoveredthrough a process of representation. In some ways cognitivism is the strongeststatement yet of the representational view of the mind inaugurated by Descartesand Locke. Indeed, Jerry Fodor, one of cognitivism’s leading and most eloquentexponents, goes so far as to say that the onlyrespect in which cognitivism is a major advance over eighteenth- andnineteenth-century representationism is in its use of the computer as a modelof mind.[6](#c7_note_6) 

As we have seen,however, cognitivism is only one variety of cognitive realism. In both theemergence and society of mind approaches (and in the schools of basic elementsanalysis for the experiential pole of our investigation), the notion ofrepresentation becomes more and more problematical. We did not explicitlyquestion this notion in our discussion of the varieties of cognitive realism,but if we look back on our journey, we can see that we have slowly drifted awayfrom the idea of mind as an input-output device that processes information. Therole of the environment has quietly moved from being the preeminent referencepoint to receding more and more into the background, while the idea of mind asan emergent and autonomous network of relationships has gained a central place.It is time, then, to raise the question, What is it about such networks, ifanything, that is representational? 

To make this questionsomewhat more accessible, consider once again Minsky’s discussion toward theend of Society of Mind. There he writes, “Whenever wespeak about a mind, we’re speaking of the processes that carry our brains fromstate to state … concerns about minds are really concerns with relationshipsbetween states—and this has virtually nothing to do with the natures of thestates themselves.”[7](#7_15) How, then, are we to understandthese relationships? What is it about them that makes them mindlike? 

The answer that isusually given to this question is, of course, that these relationships must beseen as embodying or supporting representations of the environment. Notice,however, that if we claim that the function of these processes is to representan independent environment, then we are committed to construing these processesas belonging to the class of systems that are driven from the outside, that aredefined in terms of external mechanisms of control (a heteronomoussystem). Thus we will consider information to be a prespecified quantity, onethat exists independently in the world and can act as the input to a cognitivesystem. This input provides the initial premises upon which the system computesa behavior—the output. But how are we to specify inputs and outputs for highlycooperative, self-organizing systems such as brains? There is, of course, aback-and-forth flow of energy, but where does information end and behaviorbegin? Minsky puts his finger on the problem, and his remarks are worth quotingat length: 

[Why are processes so hardto classify? In earlier times, we could usually judge machines and processes byhow they transformed raw materials into finished products. But it makes nosense to speak of brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factoriesmake cars. The difference is that brains use processes thatchange themselves—and this means we cannot separate such processes fromthe products they produce. In particular, brains make memories, which changethe ways we’ll subsequently think. The principal activitiesof brains are making changes in themselves. Because the whole idea ofself-modifying processes is new to our experience, we cannot yet trust ourcommonsense judgement about such matters.]()[8](#8_13) 

What is remarkable aboutthis passage is the absence of any notion of representation. Minsky does notsay that the principal activity of brains is to represent the external world;he says that it is to make continuous self-modifications. What has happened tothe notion of representation? 

In fact, an importantand pervasive shift is beginning to take place in cognitive science under thevery influence of its own research. This shift requires that we move away fromthe idea of the world as independent and extrinsic to the idea of a world asinseparable from the structure of these processes of self-modification. Thischange in stance does not express a mere philosophical preference; it reflectsthe necessity of understanding cognitive systems not on the basis of theirinput and output relationships but by their operationalclosure.[9](#9_15) A system that has operationalclosure is one in which the results of its processes are those processesthemselves. The notion of operational closure is thus a way of specifying classesof processes that, in their very operation, turn back upon themselves to formautonomous networks. Such networks do not fall into the class of systemsdefined by external mechanisms of control (heteronomy) but rather into theclass of systems defined by internal mechanisms of self-organization(autonomy).[10](#10_14) The key point is that suchsystems do not operate by representation. Instead of representingan independent world, they enact a world as a domainof distinctions that is inseparable from the structure embodied by thecognitive system. 

We wish to evoke thepoint that when we begin to take such a conception of mind seriously, we mustcall into question the idea that the world is pregiven and that cognition isrepresentation. In cognitive science, this means that we must call intoquestion the idea that information exists ready-made in the world and that itis extracted by a cognitive system, as the cognitivist notion of an informavore vividly implies. 

But before we go anyfurther, we need to ask ourselves why the idea of a world with pregivenfeatures or ready-made information seems so unquestionable. Why are we unableto imagine giving up this idea without falling into some sort of subjectivism,idealism, or cognitive nihilism? What is the source of this apparent dilemma?We must examine directly the feeling that arises when we sense that we can nolonger trust the world as a fixed and stable reference point. 

## TheCartesian Anxiety 

The nervousness that wefeel is rooted in what, following Richard Bernstein, we can call “the Cartesiananxiety.”[11](#11_12) We mean “anxiety” in a looselyFreudian sense, and we call it “Cartesian” simply because Descartes articulatedit rigorously and dramatically in his Meditations.The anxiety is best put as a dilemma: either we have a fixed and stablefoundation for knowledge, a point where knowledge starts, is grounded, andrests, or we cannot escape some sort of darkness, chaos, and confusion. Eitherthere is an absolute ground or foundation, or everything falls apart. 

There is a marvelouspassage from Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason thatconveys the power of the Cartesian anxiety.Throughout the Critique Kant builds the edifice ofhis theory of knowledge by arguing that we have a priori or given, innatecategories, which are the foundations of knowledge. Toward the end of hisdiscussion of the “Transcendental Analytic” he writes, 

We have now not merely explored the territory of pure understanding[the a priori categories] and carefully surveyed every part of it, but havealso measured its extent and assigned to everything in it its rightful place.This domain is an island, enclosed by nature itself with unalterable limits. Itis the land of truth—an enchanting name!—surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean,the native home of illusion, where many a fog bank and many a swiftly meltingiceberg give the deceptive appearance of farther shores, deluding theadventurous seafarer ever anew with empty hopes, and engaging him inenterprises which he can never abandon and yet is unable to carry tocompletion.[12](#12_10) 

Here we have the twoextremes, the either-or of the Cartesian anxiety: There is the enchanting landof truth where everything is clear and ultimately grounded. But beyond thatsmall island there is the wide and stormy ocean of darkness and confusion, thenative home of illusion. 

This feeling of anxietyarises from the craving for an absolute ground. When this craving cannot besatisfied, the only other possibility seems to be nihilism or anarchy. Thesearch for a ground can take many forms, but given the basic logic ofrepresentationism, the tendency is to search either for an outer ground in theworld or an inner ground in the mind. By treating mind and world as opposedsubjective and objective poles, the Cartesian anxiety oscillates endlesslybetween the two in search of a ground. 

It is important torealize that this opposition between subject and object is not given andready-made; it is an idea that belongs to the human history of mind and naturethat we mentioned in chapter 1. For example, prior to Descartes, the term“idea” was used only for the contents of the mind of God; Descartes was one ofthe first to take this term and apply it to the workings of the human mind.[13](#13_11) This linguistic and conceptualshift is one aspect of what Richard Rorty describes as the “invention of themind as a mirror of nature,” an invention that was the result of patchingtogether heterogenous images, conceptions, and linguistic usages.[14](#14_11) 

These Cartesian rootsbecome quite obvious when we have reason to doubt the appropriateness of thismetaphor of mirroring. As we set out in search of other ways of thinking, theCartesian anxiety arises to dog us at every step. Yet our contemporarysituation is also unique, for we have become increasingly skeptical about thepossibility of discerning any ultimate ground. Thus when the anxiety arisestoday, we seem unable to avoid the turn toward nihilism, for we have notlearned to let go of the forms of thinking, behavior, and experience that leadus to desire a ground. 

We saw in our previousdiscussion that cognitive science is not immune from this nihilistic tendency.For example, the link between nihilism and the Cartesian anxiety can be seenvery clearly in The Society of Mind when Minskyconfronts our inability to find a fully independent world. As he notes, theworld is not an object, event, or process inside the world.[15](#15_10)Indeed the world is more like a background—a setting of and field for all ofour experience, but one that cannot be found apart from our structure,behavior, and cognition. For this reason, what we say about the world tells usas much about ourselves as it does about the world. 

Minsky’s response tothis realization is a mixed one, in a way that is similar to his response tothe lack of a Self. He writes, “Whatever you purport to say about a thing,you’re only expressing your own beliefs. Yet even that gloomy thought suggestsan insight. Even if our models of the world cannot yield good answers about theworld as a whole, and even though their other answers are frequently wrong,they can tell us something about ourselves.”[16](#16_11) On the one hand, Minsky uses theimpossibility of finding a fully independent andpregiven world as an opportunity for developing insight into ourselves. But onthe other hand, this insight is based in a feeling of gloominess about oursituation. Why should this be? 

We have been portrayingthese ideas through the words of Minsky because he is an outstanding moderncognitive scientist and has actually taken the time to articulate his ideasclearly. But he is not alone. When pressed to discuss this issue, many peoplewould accept that we do not really have knowledge of the world; we haveknowledge only of our representations of the world. Yet we seem condemned byour constitution to treat these representations as if they were the world, forour everyday experience feels as if it were of a given and immediate world. 

Such a situation doesindeed seem gloomy. But notice that such gloominess would make sense only ifthere were a pregiven, independent world—an outer ground—but one that we couldnever know. Given such a situation, we would have no choice but to fall back onour inner representations and treat them as if they provided a stable ground. 

This mood of gloominessarises, then, from the Cartesian anxiety and its ideal of the mind as a mirrorof nature. According to this ideal, knowledge should be of an independent,pregiven world, and this knowledge should be attained in the precision of arepresentation. When this ideal cannot be satisfied, we fall back uponourselves in search of an inner ground. This oscillation is apparent inMinsky’s remark that whatever one purports to say is only an expression ofone’s beliefs. To say that what one thinks is only a matter of subjectiverepresentation is precisely to fall back upon the idea of an inner ground, asolitary Cartesian ego that is walled in by the privacy of its representations.This particular turn is all the more ironic, since Minsky does not believe thatthere exists a self that could serve as an inner ground in the first place. Inthe end, then, Minsky’s entanglement in the Cartesian anxiety requires not onlythat we believe in a self that we know cannot be found but also that we believein a world to which we have no access. And once again, the logic of such apredicament leads inevitably to a condition of nihilism. 

## Stepsto a Middle Way 

We have already seen inour exploration of human experience through the practice ofmindfulness/awareness that our grasping after an inner ground is the essence ofego-self and is the source of continuous frustration. We can now begin toappreciate that this grasping after an inner ground is itself a moment in alarger pattern of grasping that includes our clinging to an outer ground in theform of the idea of a pregiven and independent world. In other words, ourgrasping after a ground, whether inner or outer, is the deep source offrustration and anxiety. 

This realization lies atthe heart of the theory and practice of the Madhyamakaor “middle way” school of the Buddhist tradition. Whether one tries to find anultimate ground inside or outside the mind, the basic motivation and pattern ofthinking is the same, namely, the tendency to grasp. In Madhyamaka, thishabitual tendency is considered to be the root of the two extremes of“absolutism” and “nihilism.” At first, the grasping mind leads one to searchfor an absolute ground—for anything, whether inner or outer, that might byvirtue of its “own-being” be the support and foundation for everything else.Then faced with its inability to find any such ultimate ground, the graspingmind recoils and clings to the absence of a ground by treating everything elseas illusion. 

There are, then, twofundamental respects in which the philosophical analysis of Madhyamaka isdirectly relevant to our predicament. First, it explicitly recognizes that thesearch for an ultimate ground—what today we would call the projectof foundationalism—is not limited to the notion of the subject and its basis in what we have called ego-self; it also includes our belief in a pregiven orready-made world. This point, realized in India centuries ago and elaborated inthe diverse cultural settings of Tibet, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, hasonly begun to be appreciated in Western philosophy in the past one hundredyears or so. Indeed, most of Western philosophy has been concerned with theissue of where an ultimate ground is to be found, not with calling intoquestion or becoming mindful of this very tendency to cling to a ground. 

Second, Madhyamakaexplicitly recognizes the link between absolutism and nihilism. Ourethnocentric narratives tell us that concern with nihilism—in its preciseNietzschean sense—is a Western phenomenon due, among other things, to thecollapse of theism in the nineteenth century and the rise of modernism. Thepresence of a deep concern with nihilism in Indian philosophy from evenpre-Buddhist times should challenge such an ethnocentric assumption. 

Within the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation, the motivation has been to develop a directand stable insight into absolutism and nihilism as forms of grasping thatresult from the attempt to find a stable ego-self and so limit our lived worldto the experience of suffering and frustration. By progressively learning tolet go of these tendencies to grasp, one can begin to appreciate that allphenomena are free of any absolute ground and that such “groundlessness”(sunyata) is the very fabric of dependent coorigination. 

We could make a somewhatsimilar point phenomenologically by saying that groundlessness is the verycondition for the richly textured and interdependent world of human experience.We expressed this point in our very first chapter by saying that all of ouractivities depend on a background that can never be pinned down with any senseof ultimate solidity and finality. Groundlessness, then, is to be found not insome far off, philosophically abstruse analysis but in everyday experience.Indeed, groundlessness is revealed in cognition as “common sense,” that is, inknowing how to negotiate our way through a world that is not fixed and pregivenbut that is continually shaped by the types of actions in which we engage. 

Cognitive science hasresisted this view, preferring to see any form of experience as at best “folkpsychology,” that is, as a rudimentary form of explanation that can bedisciplined by representational theories of mind. Thus the usual tendency is tocontinue to treat cognition as problem solving in some pregiven task domain.The greatest ability of living cognition, however, consists in being able topose, within broad constraints, the relevant issues that need to be addressedat each moment. These issues and concerns are not pregiven but are enacted from a background of action, where what counts asrelevant is contextually determined by our common sense.

# [8 ]()Enaction: Embodied Cognition 

## Recovering Common Sense 

The tacit assumptionbehind the varieties of cognitive realism (cognitivism, emergence, and thesociety of mind) has been that the world can be divided into regions ofdiscrete elements and tasks. Cognition consists in problem solving, which must,if it is to be successful, respect the elements, properties, and relationswithin these pregiven regions. 

This approach tocognition as problem solving works to some degree for task domains in which itis relatively easy to specify all possible states. Consider for example thegame of chess. It is relatively easy to define the constituents of the “spaceof chess”: there are positions on the board, rules for movements, turns thatare taken, and so on. The limits of this space are clearly defined; in fact, itis an almost crystalline world. It is not surprising, then, that chess playingby computer is an advanced art. 

For less circumscribedor well-defined task domains, however, this approach has proved to beconsiderably less productive. Consider, for example, a mobile robot that issupposed to drive a car within a city. One can still single out in this“driving space” discrete items, such as wheels and windows, red lights, andother cars. But unlike the world of chessplaying, movement among objects is nota space that can be said to end neatly at some point. Should the robot payattention to pedestrians or not? Should it take weather conditions intoaccount? Or the country in which the city is located and its unique drivingcustoms? Such a list of questions could go on forever. The driving world doesnot end at some point; it has the structure of ever-receding levels of detailthat blend into a nonspecific background. Indeed, successfully directedmovement such as driving depends upon acquired motor skills and the continuoususe of common sense or background know-how. 

Such commonsenseknowledge is difficult, perhaps impossible, to package into explicit,propositional knowledge—“knowledge that” in thephilosopher’s jargon—since it is largely a matter of readiness to hand or“knowledge how” based on the accumulation ofexperience in a vast number of cases. Recent examinations of how skills areacquired appear to confirm this point.[1](#1_17)Furthermore, when we enlarge the task domains from artificial microworlds tothe world at large, it is not clear that we can even specify what is to countas an object independent of the type of action that is being performed. Theindividuation of objects, properties, and events appears to vary according tothe task at hand.[2](#2_17) 

These points are not newto the field of cognitive science, although their full import has only begun tobe appreciated. Indeed, it is fair to say that by the 1970s, after two decadesof humblingly slow progress, it dawned on many workers in cognitive sciencethat even the simplest cognitive action requires a seemingly infinite amount ofknowledge, which we take for granted (it is so obvious as to be invisible) butwhich must be spoon-fed to the computer. The early cognitivist hope for ageneral problem solver had to be abandoned in favor of programs that would runin local knowledge domains, where small-scale problems could be solved and wherethe programmer could put into the machine as much of her background knowledgeas was necessary. Similarly, the current connectionist strategy depends eitheron restricting the space of possible attractors by means of assumptions aboutthe known properties of the world, which are incorporated as additionalconstraints for regularization,3 or, in more recentmodels, on using backpropagation methods where learning resembles the imitationof an external model. Thus in both cognitivism and connectionism, theunmanageable ambiguity of background common sense is left largely at theperiphery of the inquiry, with the hope that it will somehow eventually beclarified.[4](#4_17) 

If, however, our livedworld does not have predefined boundaries, then it seems unrealistic to expectto capture commonsense understanding in the form of a representation—where representation is understood in its strong sense as there-presentation of a pregiven world.[5](#5_17)Indeed, if we wish to recover common sense, then we must invert therepresentationist attitude by treating context-dependent know-how not as aresidual artifact that can be progressively eliminated by the discovery of moresophisticated rules but as, in fact, the very essence of creativecognition. 

This attitude towardcommon sense has begun to affect the field of cognitive science, especially inartificial intelligence. We should note, however, that the philosophical sourcefor this attitude is to be found largely in recent Continental philosophy,especially in the school of philosophical hermeneutics, which is based in theearly work of Martin Heidegger and his student Hans Gadamer.[6](#6_16)The term hermeneutics originally referred to thediscipline of interpreting ancient texts, but it has been extended to denotethe entire phenomenon of interpretation, understood as the enactmentor bringing forth of meaning from a background ofunderstanding. In general, Continental philosophers, even when they explicitlycontest many of the assumptions underlying hermeneutics, have continued toproduce detailed discussions that show how knowledge depends on being in aworld that is inseparable from our bodies, our language, and our socialhistory—in short, from our embodiment.[7](#c8_note_7) 

Although severalcognitive scientists have recently turned to these discussions for inspiration,the spontaneous philosophy of cognitive science continues to resist such anonobjectivist orientation. The varieties of cognitive realism are inparticular strongly tied to analytic philosophy, which tends to view folk psychologyas a tacit theory in need of either reduction or replacement.[8](#8_15)Indeed, it is fair to say that analytic philosophy in general resists thisnotion of cognition as embodied understanding. Thus as Mark Johnson notes in arecent work, 

The idea that understanding is an event in which one has a world, or,more properly, a series of ongoing related meaning events in which one’s worldstands forth, has long been recognized on the Continent, especially in the workof Heidegger and Gadamer. But Anglo-American analytic philosophy hassteadfastly resisted this orientation in favor of meaning as a fixed relationbetween words and the world. It has been mistakenly assumed that only aviewpoint that transcends human embodiment, cultural embeddedness, imaginativeunderstanding, and location within historically evolving traditions canguarantee the possibility of objectivity.[9](#9_17)

The central insight ofthis nonobjectivist orientation is the view that knowledge is the result of anongoing interpretation that emerges from our capacities of understanding. Thesecapacities are rooted in the structures of our biological embodiment but arelived and experienced within a domain of consensual action and culturalhistory. They enable us to make sense of our world; or in more phenomenologicallanguage, they are the structures by which we exist in the manner of “having aworld.” To quote Johnson once more, 

[Meaning includes patternsof embodied experience and preconceptual structures of our sensibility (i.e.,our mode of perception, or orienting ourselves, and of interacting with otherobjects, events, or persons). These embodied patterns do not remain private orpeculiar to the person who experiences them. Our community helps us interpretand codify many of our felt patterns. They become shared cultural modes ofexperience and help to determine the nature of our meaningful, coherentunderstanding of our “world.”]()[10](#10_16) 

Although these themesare derived from Continental philosophy, most of the Continental discussionshave proceeded without taking into consideration scientific research on cognition—themajor exception being the early work of Merleau-Ponty. The challenge posed bycognitive science to the Continental discussions, then, is to link the study ofhuman experience as culturally embodied with the study of human cognition inneuroscience, linguistics, and cognitive psychology. In contrast, the challengeposed to cognitive science is to question one of the more entrenchedassumptions of our scientific heritage—that the world is independent of theknower. If we are forced to admit that cognition cannot be properly understoodwithout common sense, and that common sense is none other than our bodily andsocial history, then the inevitable conclusion is that knower and known, mindand world, stand in relation to each other through mutual specification ordependent coorigination. 

If this critique isvalid, then scientific progress in understanding cognition will not beforthcoming unless we start from a different basis from the idea of a pregivenworld that exists “out there” and is internally recovered in a representation.In recent years, a few researchers within cognitive science have taken thiscritique from the philosophical level into the laboratory and into specificwork in AI. These researchers have put forth concrete proposals that involve amore radical departure from cognitivism than is found in the emergenceapproach, and yet they incorporate the ideas and methods developed within thiscontext. 

## Self-OrganizationRevisited 

In the previous chapter,we discussed how cognitive science has slowly drifted away from the idea ofmind as an input–output device that processes information toward the idea ofmind as an emergent and autonomous network. We intend to make this idea moretangible by providing a concrete example of what we mean by an autonomoussystem. 

Our example is based onthe simple cellular automata, which we introduced to exemplify how systemsexhibit emergent properties when endowed with network architectures. In theprevious account these cellular automata were completely decoupled entities,and so their emergent states were not constrained by a history of coupling withan appropriate world. By enriching our account to include this dimension of structural coupling, we can begin to appreciate thecapacity of a complex system to enact a world.[11](#11_14) 

There are many forms ofcoupling that we could provide for our rings. Let us suppose, though, that wesimply drop the ring into a milieu of random 0s and 1s, much like a cell thatis plunged into a chemical milieu. Imagine further that when one of the cellsof this automata encounters one of these two alternatives (0s and 1s), thestate of the cell is replaced by the perturbation that it encountered (see [figure 8.1](#fig_001_4)).For the sake of brevity, let us give the name Bittorioto this particular ring of cellular automata having this form of structuralcoupling with the chosen milieu. 

![9739_008_fig_001.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image037.png)

In [figure 8.2](#fig_002_3), the arrow to theleft indicates the moment where one perturbation reaches one particular cell atone particular instant. The dynamics that follow indicate the ensuing change(or lack of it), that is, the way in which Bittorio compensates for thisperturbation. If Bittorio’s rule belongs to the first or fourth class (a simpleor a chaotic attractor), then the consequence of the perturbation is simplyinvisible: Bittorio either goes back to its previous homogenous state, or itremains in a randomlike state. 

![9739_008_fig_002.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image039.png)

[Figure 8.2](#fig_002a_3) Bittorio’s lifehistory showing changes in this history depending on the perturbations itencounters. 

It follows that only thesecond and third classes of rules can provide us with dynamics capable ofproducing interesting consequences for the kind of structural coupling we havechosen for Bittorio. As [figure 8.2](#fig_002_3)shows, for Bittorios with these rules a single perturbation induces a changefrom one to another spatiotemporal configuration. Both of these configurationsare stable and distinguishable. 

The case of Bittorio ofrule 10010000, illustrated in [figure 8.3](#fig_003_3), is worth commenting on in more detail. As can be seen, the encounter with just oneperturbation changes the spatial periodicities from one to another stableconfiguration. But a second perturbation at the same cell undoes the previouschange. Hence any odd sequence of perturbations at the same locus will lead toa change in state configuration for Bittorio, whereas any even sequence ofperturbations will be invisible since it leaves Bittorio unchanged. Thus of allthe innumerable sequences of possible perturbations, this Bittorio picks up orsingles out from the milieu a very specific subset, namely, finite oddsequences, since only these sequences induce a repeatable change in Bittorio’sconfiguration. In other words, given its rule and given its form of structuralcoupling, this Bittorio becomes an “odd sequence recognizer.”

Another example of suchemergent significations is shown in [figure 8.4](#fig_004_3) for Bittorio of rule01101110. Here a sequence of two perturbations is the only trigger capable ofleading to a change in the state configuration of Bittorio. This is readilyseen in [figure 8.4](#fig_004_3) where wehave superimposed several encounters at different cellular loci to facilitatecomparison. Anything other than double perturbations in one location leavesthis Bittorio unchanged. 

![9739_008_fig_004.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image043.png)

[Figure 8.4](#fig_004a_3) A Bittorioresponsive to a sequence of double perturbations. 

Other explorations withsimultaneous perturbations and more complex forms of structural coupling revealmore rich and interesting behaviors for these Boolean cellular automata. Theabove examples, however, are enough for the purposes of illustration here. 

We wish to emphasizethat in these two specific cases ([figures8.3](#fig_003_3) and [8.4](#fig_004_3)) wehave not provided Bittorio with a program to distinguish “odd sequences” or“two successive perturbations.” Instead we have specified, on the one hand, aform of closure for the system (the network’s internal dynamical emergences)and, on the other hand, the way in which this system will couple with a givenmilieu (replacement of the state of each cell with the perturbation itencounters in a milieu of random 0s and 1s). The result, however, is that overtime this coupling selects or enacts from a world of randomness a domain ofdistinctions (“odd sequences” or “two successive perturbations”) that hasrelevance for the structure of the system. In other words, on the basis of itsautonomy the system selects or enacts a domain of significance. 

We use these words significance and relevanceadvisedly, for they imply that there is some kind of interpretation involved inthe encounters. In the case of Bittorio, this interpretation is obviously a farcry from the kinds of interpretation that depend on experience. Nevertheless,we can say that a minimal kind of interpretation is involved, where interpretation is understood widely to mean the enactmentof a domain of distinctions out of a background. Thus Bittorio, on the basis ofits autonomy (closure), performs an interpretation in the sense that it selectsor brings forth a domain of significance out of the background of its randommilieu. 

The distinctions thatBittorio selects, such as odd sequences, indicate the regularities with whichBittorio covaries. These regularities constitute what we could call Bittorio’sworld. It should be apparent that this world is not pregiven and then recoveredthrough a representation. We did not design Bittorio to be an odd sequencerecognizer; we simply provided Bittorio with certain internal dynamics and thendropped it into a random milieu. Nevertheless, given the history of coupling between the internal dynamics and the milieu, odd sequence becomes a significant distinction forBittorio. For this reason, we describe Bittorio’s world as enacted through ahistory of structural coupling. 

Bittorio provides, then,a paradigm for how closure and coupling suffice to bring forth a world ofrelevance for a system. Of course, this paradigm is rather simple. Ourintention, however, is not to provide a model of any specific phenomenon, andwe certainly do not intend to suggest that such a simple form of closure and couplingis sufficient for a system to experience a world. Rather, our intention issimply to provide a minimal example of how anautonomous system brings forth significance from a background. It is thesimplicity of the example that enables us to follow in detail the entireprocess by which a kind of distinction is enacted. 

Despite the simplicityof the example, we should not underestimate the moral it suggests. Since we canalready recognize the emergence of a minimal kind of significance with just thesimple form of autonomy (closure) and coupling given to Bittorio, imagine therich and complex kinds of significance that would be brought forth by livingcells or complex cellular networks, such as the brain and the immune system.Though far more complex and intricate, these systems nonetheless share withBittorio the properties of being autonomous (having operational closure) andbeing structurally coupled.[12](#12_12) 

Such autonomous systemsstand in sharp contrast to systems whose coupling with the environment isspecified through input/output relations. The digital computer is the mostfamiliar example of this latter kind of system. Here the meaning of a givenkeyboard sequence is always assigned by the designer. Living systems, however,are far from being in this category. Under very restricted circumstances we canspeak as if we could specify the operation of a cell or an organism throughinput/output relations. In general, though, the meaning of this or thatinteraction for a living system is not prescribed from outside but is theresult of the organization and history of the system itself. Let us now turn,then, to consider some actual living examples. 

## Color as a Study Case 

Perhaps the bestexample, one which we intend to explore in some depth here, is colorperception. We have two reasons for choosing to focus on color. First, thestudy of color provides a microcosm of cognitive science, for each disciplinein figure 1.1—neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics,and philosophy—has made important contributions to our understanding of color.Indeed, other disciplines, such as genetics and anthropology, have contributedas well. Second, color has immediate perceptual and cognitive significance inhuman experience. For these two reasons, color provides a paradigmatic domainin which our twin concerns of science and human experience naturally intersect.

For ease of expositionour discussion of color will proceed through several stages. We will firstdiscuss how colors themselves appear—what could be called the structure ofcolor appearance. We will then discuss color as a perceived attribute of thingsin the world. Finally, we will consider color as an experiential category. Letus emphasize that these stages are not found separately in experience; ourexperience is simultaneously shaped by all three. Theories of color do,however, tend to take as their point of departure one or the other of thesethree aspects. Thus our stages, though expository, are not arbitrary. 

### ColorAppearance 

Let us begin, then, notwith the visual system or with colored objects but simply with color itself.There are two important features of the structure of color appearance. First,all of the colors that we see can be described as some combination of six basiccolors: red, green, yellow, blue, black, and white. For example, orange is acombination of red and yellow; turquoise is a combination of blue and green;violet and indigo are combinations of red and blue, etc. Second, the appearanceof color varies along three dimensions, those of hue, saturation, andbrightness. Hue refers to the degree of redness,greenness, yellowness, or blueness of a given color. Red, green, yellow, andblue are the four fundamental or psychologically unique hues, which combine toform complex or psychologically binary hues. For example, red and yellowcombine to form reddish-yellows and yellowish-reds (oranges), whereas blue andred combine to form blueish-reds and reddish-blues (purples). For each uniquehue, there is another unique hue with which it cannot coexist to form a binaryhue. Thus red cannot coexist with green, and yellow cannot coexist with blue.Red and green are therefore known as opponent hues,as are blue and yellow. It should be noted that not every color need be of acertain hue. White and black, as well as the intermediate shades of gray, arecolors, but they have no hue. They are therefore known as achromaticcolors—colors that have zero hue—whereas colors with hue are called chromatic.The chromatic colors can also differ in the strength or saturationof their hue. Saturated colors have a greater degree of hue, whereasdesaturated colors are closer to gray. Brightness isthe final dimension of color appearance. Along this dimension, colors vary fromdazzling at one end to dim or barely visible at the other end. 

Why does color have thisstructure? Why, for example, are hues organized into pairs that are mutuallyexclusive or opponent? The model of color vision that takes as its point ofdeparture the structure of color appearance, and so attempts to answer thesequestions, is known as the opponent-process theory.This theory owes its origin to the research of the nineteenth-centuryphysiologist Ewald Hering but was proposed in its modern form by Leo Hurvichand Dorothea Jameson in 1957.[13](#13_13) According to this theory, thereare three color “channels” in the visual system: one channel is achromatic andsignals differences in brightness; the other two are chromatic and signaldifferences in hue. It should be noted that these channels are specified inpsychophysical experiments, not neurophysiological ones. The exact nature oftheir physiological embodiment is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, it isaccepted that the channels correspond in some way to the complexcross-connections among retinal cells and postretinal neuronal ensembles. 

In the retina there arethree different but intermingled mosaics of cone cells, whose overlappingphotopigment absorption curves peak around 560, 530, and 440 nanometersrespectively. These three cone mosaics constitute the so-called long-wave (L),middle-wave (M), and short-wave (S) receptors. Excitatory and inhibitoryprocesses in postreceptoral cells enable the signals from these receptors to beadded and/or subtractively compared. In the opponent-process model, theaddition of the signals from all three receptors generates the achromatic(brightness) channel. The difference between the signals from the L and Mreceptors generates the red-green channel, and the difference between the sumof the signals from the L and M receptors and the signals from the S receptorsgenerates the yellow-blue channel. These two chromatic channels are opponent:an increase in red is always gained at the expense of green and vice-versa; anincrease in yellow is always gained at the expense of blue and vice-versa. 

This opponent-processtheory explains the structure of color appearance by showing how it resultsfrom the differential responses of the achromatic and chromatic channels. Thusthe organization of hues into mutually exclusive or antagonistic pairs reflectsan underlying opponent organization. We never experience any color to be acombination of red and green, or yellow and blue, because the chromaticchannels cannot simultaneously signal “red” and “green,” or “yellow” and “blue.”The opponent-process theory also explains why some hues are unique and othersare binary. Unique hues result from a signal from onechromatic channel while the other chromatic channel is neutral or balanced. Forexample, unique green results when the red-green channel signals “green” andthe yellow-blue channel is neutral so that it signals neither “yellow” nor“blue.” Binary hues, on the other hand, result from the interplay of the twochannels with each other. Thus orange results from the red-green channelsignaling “red” and the yellow-blue channel signaling “yellow.” 

Now that we have a basicunderstanding of how color appearance is generated, let us turn to the secondstage in our investigation, color as a perceived attribute of things in the world.

### Coloras a Perceived Attribute 

Since we perceive colorsto be spatially located, we might assume that the color we perceive an area tohave can be correlated with the light reflected locally from that area. Thus ifsome area looks whiter than another, it must be because more light is reflectedfrom the area. Or if some area looks green, it must be that the area reflectspredominantly middle-wave light. If we fail to see the area as green in such asituation, then our perception must be mistaken; what we see must be anillusion. 

If we examine thesituation more closely, however, we are in for interesting surprises. If weactually measure the light reflected from the world around us, we will discoverthat there simply is no one-to-one relationship between light flux at variouswavelengths and the colors we perceive areas to have. Suppose, for example,that we perceive some area to be green. Areas that look green typically reflecta high percentage of middle-wave light and a low percentage of long-wave andshort-wave light. We might suppose, then, that the area looks green because itreflects more middle-wave light to the eye. This supposition would be true,however, only in the limited case where the area is viewed in isolation, thatis, if we exclude everything else from the field of view. But when this area isviewed as part of a complex scene, it will continue to look green even if itreflects more long-wave and short-wave light than middle-wave light. In otherwords, when the area is viewed as part of a complex scene, the light that itlocally reflects is not sufficient to predict its perceived color. Therefore,there simply is no one-to-one correspondence between perceived color andlocally reflected light. 

This relativeindependence of perceived color from locally reflected light has been known tovision scientists for quite some time.[14](#14_13)The independence is manifested in two complementary phenomena. In the first,the perceived colors of things remain relatively constant despite large changesin the illumination. This phenomenon is known as approximatecolor constancy. In the second, two areas that reflect light of the samespectral composition can be seen to have different colors depending on thesurroundings in which they are placed. This phenomenon is known as simultaneous color contrast or chromaticinduction.[15](#15_12) 

These two phenomenaforce us to conclude that we cannot account for our experience of color as anattribute of things in the world by appealing simply to the intensity andwavelength composition of the light reflected from an area. Instead, we need toconsider the complex and only partially understood processes of cooperative comparisonamong multiple neuronal ensembles in the brain, which assign colors to objectsaccording to the emergent, global states they reach given a retinal image. 

Consider the followinginteresting demonstration. We take two identical slide projectors superimposedover a common screen and fit each with identical copies of a slide containing acheckerboard of grays, whites, and blacks. The two slides are superimposed sothat they are exactly aligned. We also put a red filter in one of theprojectors, so that the overall pattern that results is an array of pinks ofdifferent saturations. Let us now turn one slide by 90 degrees. The result is afull, multicolored image, containing small squares that are yellow, blue, andgreen, as well as red and pink.[16](#16_13) 

The effect of this experiment is quite dramatic: a multicolored imagearises where physics would lead us to expect only various shades of pink. Thischromatic effect can be described by the white-to-white and red-to-red ratiosacross the edges of the small squares accomplished by the rotation of one ofthe slides. How can this happen? 

As we mentioned whendiscussing the opponent-process theory, the light that reaches the eye perturbsthree different but intermingled mosaics of cones, which constitute threeretinal surfaces: the S, M, and L receptors. These three retinal surfaces areby no means identical or homogenous. For example, the L receptor has a densityof cones about five times higher than the S receptor and slightly less than theM receptor. Furthermore, due to the inner connectivity of the retina, localdifferences of activity in the three receptor surfaces depend on what happensin the rest of the retina. In this manner, internal relativevalues are generated. Abrupt deviations from such reference values in the locallevels of activity become the difference that makes a difference: within theboundaries of such deviations a uniform color is perceived. 

This descriptionhighlights the emergent configurations at the retinal level and so is onlypartial. There are structures at all levels of the visual pathways thatparticipate in the perception of color. In primates, the participation ofsubensembles of neurons in color perception has been demonstrated in thethalamus (LGN), primary and extrastriate visual cortex, inferotemporal cortex,and frontal lobes.[17](#17_11) Most notable is a collection ofneurons in the so-called area V4 of the extrastriate cortex where evenindividual neuronal responses can be roughly associated with the colorconstancies of a visual field.[18](#18_11) These neuronal structuresconstitute a color subnetwork—a sort of perceptual “agent,” to use Minsky’sterminology. Thus nothing short of a large and distributed neuronal network isinvolved in our perception of color. 

Colors are not, ofcourse, perceived in isolation from other attributes, such as shape, size,texture, motion, and orientation. For example, the artist Kandinsky commentedon the relation between color and motion. In one of his essays he wrote, “Iftwo circles are drawn and painted respectively yellow and blue, a briefcontemplation will reveal in the yellow a spreading movement out from thecenter, and a noticeable approach to the spectator. The blue, on the otherhand, moves into itself, like a snail retreating into its shell, and draws awayfrom the spectator. The eye feels stung by the first circle while it isabsorbed into the second.”[19](#19_11) 

The motion thatKandinsky refers to here is obviously not movement in the physical space of thepicture. It is, rather, motion in our perceptual space. As Mark Johnson notesin a discussion of this passage from Kandinsky, “The ‘movement’ refers tostructures in our perceptual interaction, in which we form unified images andtrace out relations among the various elements in the work.”[20](#20_11) 

Recent trends inphysiology enable us to understand the bodily basis for these “structures ofperceptual interaction.” In recent years physiology has moved toward the studyof vision as a patchwork of visual modalities, including at least form (shape,size, rigidity), surface properties (color, texture, specular reflectance,transparency), three-dimensional spatial relationships (relative positions,three-dimensional orientation in space, distance), and three-dimensionalmovement (trajectory, rotation). It has become evident that these differentvisual modalities are emergent properties of concurrent subnetworks, which havea degree of independence and even anatomical separability but cross-correlateand work together so that at almost every moment a visual percept is coherent.[21](#21_11) (This kind of architecture is,once again, strongly reminiscent of Minsky’s societies of agents.) [Figure 8.5](#fig_005_2)depicts some of the identified anatomical elements of these visual subnetworks.Among the modalities, color seems to be one of the more simple, for colorindicators can be obtained solely on the basis of luminance and contrastlevels. This simplicity betrays, however, the equally important fact that coloris always perceived within a more encompassing visual context. All of thesubnetworks work cooperatively; we never see color as an isolated item. 

![9739_008_fig_005.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image045.png)

[Figure 8.5](#fig_005a_2) Parallel streams inthe visual pathway. From DeYoe and Van Essen, Concurrent processing streams inmonkey visual cortex. 

Furthermore, visualperception is in active exchange with other sensory modalities. For example,the associations of color and sound, as well as color and horizontal/verticalperception (involving the sense of orientation and equilibrium), are well knownto artists, though less studied by neurobiologists. Beyond these intermodalrelations there are, of course, varieties of cognitive expectancies andmemories. Such “top-down” dependency is to be expected, for, like those of theLGN and visual cortex, the pathways depicted in [figure 8.5](#fig_005_2) are all bidirectional. Thus, to reiterateone of our central points, the neuronal network does not function as a one-waystreet from perception to action. Perception and action, sensorium and motorium,are linked together as successively emergent and mutually selecting patterns. 

To bring home this pointthat color perception partakes of both other visual and sensory modalities, letus consider a much more dramatic example: the complete loss of colorperception. In a recent article Oliver Sacks and Robert Wasserman presented anaccount of a patient who, due to an accident, became completely color-blind.[22](#22_11) This particular case of so-calledacquired cerebral achromatopsia is fascinating because it occurred in an artistknown for his especially colorful, abstract paintings. As a result of a caraccident, this person—referred to as “Mr. I”—could no longer perceive anycolors: he lived in a visual world that resembled black-and-white television. 

The participation ofcolor perception in other modalities of experience is evident from Mr. I’sdescriptions in the weeks following his accident. Because of the absence ofcolor, the overall character of his experience changed dramatically: everythinghe saw “had a distasteful, ‘dirty’ look, the whites glaring, yet discolored andoff-white, the blacks cavernous—everything wrong, unnatural, stained, andimpure.”23 As a result, hefound foods disgusting and sexual intercourse impossible. He could no longervisually imagine colors, nor could he dream in color. His appreciation of musicwas also impaired, for he could no longer experience musical tones bysynestheticly transforming them into plays of color. Eventually, Mr. I seemedto forget completely his former world of color. His habits, behavior, andactions changed as he became progressively more of a “night person.” In hiswords, “I love the nighttime. … I often wonder about people who work at night.They never see the sunlight. They prefer it. … It’s a different world: there’sa lot of space—you’re not hemmed in by streets, people. … It’s a whole newworld. Gradually I am becoming a night person. At one time I felt kindly towardcolor, very happy about it. In the beginning, I felt very bad, losing it. Now Idon’t even know it exists—it’s not even a phantom.”[24](#24_9)

This descriptionprovides rare insight into how our perceived world, which we usually take forgranted, is constituted through complex and delicate patterns of sensorimotoractivity. Our colored world is brought forth by complex processes of structuralcoupling. When these processes are altered, some forms of behavior are nolonger possible. One’s behavior changes as one learns to cope with newconditions and situations. And, as one’s actions change, so too does one’ssense of the world. If these changes are dramatic enough—as in Mr. I’s loss ofcolor—then a different perceived world will be enacted. 

The preceding exampleshave shown us how color as an attribute is intimately involved with otherattributes of our perceived world. Our examination so far shows that we willnot be able to explain color if we seek to locate it in a world independent ofour perceptual capacities. Instead, we must locate color in the perceived orexperiential world that is brought forth from our history of structuralcoupling. Indeed, this point will become even more apparent when we considercolor as an experiential category. Before we turn to this third stage in ourdiscussion of color, however, let us pause to consider an objection. 

### WhereIs Color? 

Suppose someone, inreply to our discussion, were to demand, “What is the point of all these complexneuronal processes if not to compensate for the changes in illumination andrecover some stable feature of objects? Consider, for example, the surfacereflectance of an object. This property corresponds to the percentage ofincident light at each wavelength that an object reflects. This percentage orratio describes the way in which an object, by virtue of its physicalconstitution, alters the ambient light; it is therefore a stable property, onethat remains constant through changes in illumination. Why not say, then, thatalthough we must account for color experience by revealing its constitutionthrough emergent patterns of neuronal activity, this experience is nonethelessa result of having to solve the information-processing problem of recovering surfacereflectance?” 

Recent computationalmodels of color vision seem to support this line of argument. The surfacereflectances of objects in our surrounding world, such as bricks, grass,buildings, etc., can be expressed in a rather limited (three-dimensional) setof prototypical functions.[25](#25_9) Thus it would seem that all thevisual system has to do is sample the scene with its three color channels andthereby reconstitute the surface reflectances from the activity in thesechannels. On the basis of these models, several vision scientists, as well ascertain philosophers, have argued not only that the function of color vision isthe recovery of surface reflectance but also that color itself is just the propertyof surface reflectance.[26](#26_9) 

This objectivistproposal gives rise to several considerable problems, which serve to reinforceour point that the colors we see must be located not in a pregiven world butrather in the perceived world brought forth from our structural coupling.Consider first the idea that color is just surface reflectance. We have alreadyseen that colors have certain properties and bear certain relations to eachother: color varies along the three dimensions ofhue, saturation, and brightness; hues are either unique or binary and areorganized into opponent pairs, etc. Now if color is just surface reflectance,we should be able to match these features of color with corresponding featuresof surface reflectance. But there are no such corresponding features. Surfacereflectances can be classified according to whether they reflect more or lesslight in the short-, middle-, and/or long-wave regions of the spectrum, butthey cannot be classified as being unique or binary, nor can they be classifiedas standing in opponent relations to other reflectances. Nor can theseproperties of uniqueness, binariness, and opponency be found in the structureof light. For these reasons, the properties that specify what colors are simplyhave no nonexperiential, physical counterparts.[27](#c8_note_27)

Second, color is notsimply a perceived attribute of surfaces; it is also a perceived attribute ofvolumes such as the sky. Furthermore, we experience colors as attributes ofafterimages and in dreams, memories, and synesthesia. The unity among thesephenomena is not to be found in some nonexperiential, physical structure butrather in color as a form of experience that is constituted through emergentpatterns of neuronal activity. 

Let us now consider theidea that the function of color vision is to represent and thereby recoversurface reflectance. The first thing to note about this idea is that it arisesnot from the biological and ecological investigation of color vision but fromthe engineering attempt to devise a system that will be able to detect objectsby discounting variations in the illumination and recovering the invariantreflectances in a scene. Although this engineering research program is ofconsiderable importance for our understanding of the more abstract principlesinvolved in vision, it should not be allowed to dictate conclusions about thebiological and ecological purposes that natural color vision serves. Indeed,attention to these biological and ecological purposes reveals that color visionis concerned as much with properties that change, such as lighting, weatherconditions, and time of day, as with properties that remain constant, such assurface reflectance.[28](#28_7) 

Finally, there is ahidden, but much deeper problem with the objectivist view of color vision: theobjectivist simply assumes that surface reflectances are to be found in somepregiven world that is independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities.But how are we to specify what counts as a surface? How are we to specify itsedges, boundaries, texture, and orientation, if not in relation to someperceiver for whom these distinctions are relevant? 

The objectivistsupposition that surface reflectances are pregiven rests on the assumption thatsince surface reflectance is a physical property, it can be measured andspecified in entirely physical terms. But although the reflectance at any pointin a scene can be specified in physical terms, what counts as a surface may infact involve tacit reference to a type of perceiver. This point is obscured incomputational models that emphasize the limited dimensions in which so-callednaturally occurring reflectances can vary. If we actually examine these models,we will see that the natural reflectances correspond not only to thereflectances of typical objects from our human environment, as opposed to theenvironments of considerably different visual creatures, but also that theseobjects have been picked out or specified prior to the actual task of vision.In other words, these models treat the visual system as if it were simplypresented with a certain class of prespecified objects whose reflectances mustthen be recovered. 

This approach involves aconsiderable and artificial simplification of our actual perceptual situation.The visual system is never simply presented with pregiven objects. On thecontrary, the determination of what and where an object is, as well as itssurface boundaries, texture, and relative orientation (and hence the overallcontext of color as a perceived attribute), is a complex process that thevisual system must continually achieve. This achievement, as we have seen inour discussion of the patchwork architecture of vision, results from a complexcooperative process involving active dialogue among all the visual modalities.Indeed, color vision is actually involved in the cooperative processes by whichthe visual scene comes to be segmented into a collection of surfaces. In thewords of P. Gouras and E. Zrenner, “It is impossibleto separate the object sensed from its color because it is the color contrastitself that forms the object.”[29](#29_6) Thus colors and surfaces gotogether: both depend on our embodied perceptual capacities. 

### Coloras a Category 

Our discussion so farhas concentrated on the perception of color, considered either on its own terms(color appearance), as it were, or as an attribute of things (surface colors,volume colors, etc.). But our experience of color is not only perceptual; it isalso cognitive: we organize all the various hue/saturation/brightnesscombinations that we perceive into a limited set of color categories and givenames to these categories. As we will now see, color categories provide yetanother dramatic illustration of how color is brought forth. 

#### Linguistic Aspects of Color 

Consider the numerousnames that we have in English for colors: red, yellow, orange, green, blue,purple, violet, indigo, pink, turquoise, aquamarine, mauve, chartreuse, etc.Given these many names, as well as the numerous names in other languages, wemight suppose that color categories are ultimately arbitrary, that is, thatnothing compels us to categorize colors in one way rather than another. Indeed,this view was at one time dominant within the fields of linguistics andanthropology.[30](#30_7) 

This view wasdramatically challenged in 1969 with the publication of a now classic work byBrent Berlin and Paul Kay.[31](#31_4) In this work, Berlin and Kayspecified a set of linguistic criteria for determining which color names in agiven language constitute “basic” color terms. These basic color terms name thebasic color categories in a given language. Then, in an examination of overninety languages, Berlin and Kay determined that there are at most eleven basiccolor categories encoded in any language, though not all languages encode alleleven. These basic categories are red, green, blue, yellow, black, white,gray, orange, purple, brown, and pink. Berlin and Kay also presented speakersof various languages with a standardized array of color chips and asked them tospecify both the boundaries and the best examples of the colors to which theirbasic terms refer. They found that although there was considerable variationamong speakers over color category boundaries, individuals virtually alwaysagreed on the best example of a color category. Furthermore, they found thatwhen several languages contained a common basic term, such as a basic term forblue, speakers virtually always agreed on the best example of the colorcategory no matter which language they spoke. Berlin and Kay argued thereforethat the basic color categories do not have a uniform structure, for somemembers of the categories are central and so constitute category “foci.” Sincethese central members are universally agreed upon, Berlin and Kay con­cludedthat “the eleven basic color categories are pan-human perceptual universals.”[32](#32_5) 

Although some languagesdo not encode all eleven basic color categories, we should not suppose that thecolor domain is impoverished for speakers of these languages. On the contrary,the set of basic color terms in a given language always encompasses the entirecolor space. For example, the language of the Dani tribe of New Guinea has onlytwo basic color terms. In studies of the Dani, Rosch (then Heider) showed thatthese two terms, which had previously been translated as “white” and “black,”were actually better translated as “white-warm” and “dark-cool,” for the formerterm covered white plus all the warm colors (red, yellow, orange,reddish-purple, pink), whereas the latter covered black plus all the coolcolors (blue, green).[33](#33_3) 

#### Colorand Cognition 

The studies we havediscussed so far have been about color language. There is an entire subfield inpsychology, called language and cognition, that considers and disputes the waysin which language and cognition may or may not be related. Prior to Berlin andKay, a well-known series of experiments had demonstrated that memory for colors(a cognitive variable) was a function of color naming (a linguistic variable).[34](#34_3) Since naming was assumed to beculturally relative, it was thus argued and widely accepted that cognition hadbeen demonstrated to be culturally relative. But what if both color languageand color cognition are functions of some third underlying factor—colorphysiology, for example? A natural laboratory for testing such questions wasprovided by the Dani of New Guinea since their language lacked virtually allcolor vocabulary. In a series of experiments, Rosch found that (1) centralmembers of basic color categories were perceptually more salient, could belearned more rapidly, and were more easily remembered in both short-term andlong-term memory than were peripheral colors, even by speakers of Dani who donot have names for the central colors; (2) the structures of the color spacesderived from Dani and English color naming were very different but were quitesimilar for those derived from Dani and English color memory; and (3) when Daniwere taught basic color categories, they found it quite easy to learncategories that were structured in the universal fashion (with central membersas central) but extremely difficult to learn categories that were structured ina deviant manner (with peripheral colors as central, where blue-green might becentral and blues and greens peripheral).[35](#35_3)Very similar effects were found in the development of color names in youngchildren in our own culture.[36](#36_3) All of these results arguedstrongly that both cognitive and linguistic aspects of color categorization arerelated to underlying (probably physiological) factors. Thus color categoriesappear to be a panhuman, species-specific universal. 

Our discussion so farwould seem to suggest that color categories are entirely determined by emergentpatterns of neuronal activity in the human visual system—the color subnetworkthat we reviewed above. Thus notice that the focal colors red, green, blue,yellow, black, and white can be mapped directly onto the responses of the threecolor channels in the opponent-process theory of color vision. But what aboutfocal orange, purple, brown, and pink? More recent research suggests thatdistinctly cognitive operations are required to generate these focal colors.The cognitive operations appear to be of two kinds: one is universal for ourspecies and the other is culture specific.[37](#37_1)

In 1978 Paul Kay andChad McDaniel provided a model of how color categories could be generated froma certain set of neuronal responses plus certain species-specific cognitiveprocesses.[38](#38_1) The neuronal responses correspondto the red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white responses of neuronal ensembles,such as those found by R. DeValois and G. Jacobs in the LGN of the macaque, aspecies of monkey that has color vision quite similar to ours.[39](#39_1)(One could also construct a model using the psychophysical color channels.Indeed, it is perhaps preferable to do so, since the exact neural embodiment ofthese channels is still disputed.) The cognitive processes correspond tooperations that can be modeled by using a branch of mathematics known as fuzzyset theory. Unlike standard set theory, fuzzy set theory operates with setsthat admit degrees of membership. Degree of membership in a set is specified bya function that assigns to each member of the set some value between 0 and 1.Thus for color, focal colors have degree of membership 1 in their respectivecategories, whereas nonfocal colors have degrees of membership between 0 and 1.In Kay and McDaniel’s model, the red-green, yellow-blue, and black-whiteneuronal responses directly determine the basic categories red, green, yellow,blue, black, and white. Orange, purple, brown, and pink, however, are“computed” or “generated” by cognitive operations on these neuronal responses.These cognitive operations correspond to the operation of fuzzy setintersection. Thus orange is the fuzzy intersection of red and yellow, purple of red and blue, pink of white and red,and brown of black and yellow. Since these categories require such cognitivederivations, Kay and McDaniel term them derived basiccolor categories. 

#### Color and Culture 

Finally, colorcategories depend on culture-specific cognitive processes. Thus in anotherstudy, Paul Kay and Willett Kempton found that the lexical classification ofcolors can affect subjective judgments of similarity among colors.[40](#40_1) For example, English containsterms for both green and blue, whereas Tarahumara (a Uto-Aztecan language ofnorthern Mexico) has a single term that means “green or blue.” This linguisticdifference appears to be correlated with a difference in subjective judgmentsof similarity among colors between speakers of the two languages: Englishspeakers tend to exaggerate the perceived distances of colors close to thegreen-blue boundary, whereas speakers of Tarahumara do not. 

Other evidence forculture-specific cognitive processes comes from R. E. MacLaury. He has foundthat purple is sometimes placed entirely within the cool range (blue-green) andother times on the boundary between the cool range and red and that brown issometimes placed within the yellow category and other times within black.[41](#41_1) MacLaury also reports that manyNative American languages of the Pacific Northwest encode an otherwise rare“yellow-with-green” basic category.[42](#42_1)

These examples show thatcolor categorization in its entirety depends upon a tangled hierarchy ofperceptual and cognitive processes, some species specific and others culturespecific. They also serve to illustrate the point that color categories are notto be found in some pregiven world that is independent of our perceptual andcognitive capacities. The categories red, green, yellow, blue, purple,orange—as well as light/warm, dark/cool, yellow-with-green, etc.—areexperiential, consensual, and embodied: they depend upon our biological andcultural history of structural coupling. 

We can now appreciate,then, how color provides a paradigm of a cognitive domain that is neitherpregiven nor represented but rather experiential and enacted. It is veryimportant to note that just because color is not pregiven does not mean that itdoes not exhibit universals or that it cannot yield to rigorous analysis by thevarious branches of science. Since color provides such a paradigm, we willreturn to it at various points. The time has come, however, to step back andconsider some of the lessons this cognitive domain provides for ourunderstanding of perception and cognition in general. 

## Cognitionas Embodied Action 

Let us begin, onceagain, with visual perception. Consider the question, “Which came first, theworld or the image?” The answer of most vision research—both cognitivist andconnectionist—is unambiguously given by the names of the tasks investigated.Thus researchers speak of “recovering shape from shading,” “depth from motion,”or “color from varying illuminants.” We call this stance the chicken position: 

Chickenposition: The world out there has pregivenproperties. These exist prior to the image that is cast on the cognitivesystem, whose task is to recover them appropriately (whether through symbols orglobal subsymbolic states). 

Notice how veryreasonable this position sounds and how difficult it is to imagine that thingscould be otherwise. We tend to think that the onlyalternative is the egg position: 

Eggposition: The cognitive system projects its ownworld, and the apparent reality of this world is merely a reflection ofinternal laws of the system. 

Our discussion of colorsuggests a middle way between these two chicken and egg extremes. We have seenthat colors are not “out there” independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities.We have also seen that colors are not “in here” independent of our surroundingbiological and cultural world. Contrary to the objectivist view, colorcategories are experiential; contrary to the subjectivist view, colorcategories belong to our shared biological and cultural world. Thus color as astudy case enables us to appreciate the obvious point that chicken and egg,world and perceiver, specify each other. 

It is precisely thisemphasis on mutual specification that enables us to negotiate a middle pathbetween the Scylla of cognition as the recovery of a pregiven outer world(realism) and the Charybdis of cognition as the projection of a pregiven innerworld (idealism). These two extremes both take representation as their centralnotion: in the first case representation is used to recover what is outer; inthe second case it is used to project what is inner. Our intention is to bypassentirely this logical geography of inner versus outer by studying cognition notas recovery or projection but as embodied action. 

Let us explain what wemean by this phrase embodied action. By using theterm embodied we mean to highlight two points: first,that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having abody with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individualsensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassingbiological, psychological, and cultural context.[43](#43_1)By using the term action we mean to emphasize onceagain that sensory and motor processes, perception and action, arefundamentally inseparable in lived cognition. Indeed, the two are not merelycontingently linked in individuals; they have also evolved together. 

We can now give apreliminary formulation of what we mean by enaction.In a nutshell, the enactive approach consists of two points: (1) perceptionconsists in perceptually guided action and (2) cognitive structures emerge fromthe recurrent sensorimotor patterns that enable action to be perceptuallyguided. These two statements will perhaps appear somewhat opaque, but theirmeaning will become more transparent as we proceed. 

Let us begin with thenotion of perceptually guided action. We have already seen that for therepresentationist the point of departure for understanding perception is theinformation-processing problem of recovering pregiven properties of the world.In contrast, the point of departure for the enactive approach is the study ofhow the perceiver can guide his actions in his local situation. Since theselocal situations constantly change as a result of the perceiver’s activity, thereference point for understanding perception is no longer a pregiven,perceiver-independent world but rather the sensorimotor structure of theperceiver (the way in which the nervous system links sensory and motorsurfaces). This structure—the manner in which the perceiver is embodied—ratherthan some pregiven world determines how the perceiver can act and be modulatedby environmental events. Thus the overall concern of an enactive approach toperception is not to determine how some perceiver-independent world is to berecovered; it is, rather, to determine the common principles or lawful linkagesbetween sensory and motor systems that explain how action can be perceptuallyguided in a perceiver-dependent world.[44](#44_1)

This approach toperception was in fact among the central insights of the analysis undertaken byMerleau-Ponty in his early work. It is therefore worthwhile to quote one of hismore visionary passages in full: 

[The organism cannotproperly be compared to a keyboard on which the external stimuli would play andin which their proper form would be delineated for the simple reason that theorganism contributes to the constitution of that form. … “The properties of theobject and the intentions of the subject … are not only intermingled; they alsoconstitute a new whole.” When the eye and the ear follow an animal in flight,it is impossible to say “which started first” in the exchange of stimuli andresponses. Since all the movements of the organism are always conditioned byexternal influences, one can, if one wishes, readily treat behavior as aneffect of the milieu. But in the same way, since all the stimulations which theorganism receives have in turn been possible only by its preceding movementswhich have culminated in exposing the receptor organ to external influences,one could also say that behavior is the first cause of allthe stimulations. ]()

Thus the form of the excitant is created bythe organism itself, by its proper manner of offering itself to actions fromthe outside. Doubtless, in order to be able to subsist, it must encounter acertain number of physical and chemical agents in its surroundings. But it isthe organism itself—according to the proper nature of its receptors, thethresholds of its nerve centers and the movements of the organs—which chooses the stimuli in the physical world to which it willbe sensitive. “The environment (Umwelt)emerges from the world through the actualization or the being of theorganism—[granted that] an organism can exist only if it succeeds in finding inthe world an adequate environment.” This would be a keyboard which moves itselfin such a way as to offer—and according to variable rhythms—such or such of itskeys to the in itself monotonous action of an external hammer [italics added].[45](#45_1) 

In such an approach,then, perception is not simply embedded within and constrained by thesurrounding world; it also contributes to the enactment of this surroundingworld. Thus as Merleau-Ponty notes, the organism both initiates and is shapedby the environment. Merleau-Ponty clearly recognized, then, that we must seethe organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification andselection. 

Let us now provide a fewillustrations of the perceptual guidance of action. In a classic study, Heldand Hein raised kittens in the dark and exposed them to light only undercontrolled conditions.[46](#46_1) A first group of animals wasallowed to move around normally, but each of them was harnessed to a simplecarriage and basket that contained a member of the second group of animals. Thetwo groups therefore shared the same visual experience, but the second groupwas entirely passive. When the animals were released after a few weeks of thistreatment, the first group of kittens behaved normally, but those who had beencarried around behaved as if they were blind: they bumped into objects and fellover edges. This beautiful study supports the enactive view that objects arenot seen by the visual extraction of features but rather by the visual guidanceof action. 

Lest the reader feelthat this example is fine for cats but removed from human experience, consideranother case. Bach y Rita has designed a video camera for blind persons thatcan stimulate multiple points in the skin by electrically activated vibration.[47](#47_1) Using this technique, imagesformed with the camera were made to correspond to patterns of skin stimulation,thereby substituting for the visual loss. Patterns projected on to the skinhave no “visual” content unless the individual is behaviorally active bydirecting the video camera using head, hand, or body movements. When the blindperson does actively behave in this way, after a few hours of experience aremarkable emergence takes place: the person no longer inteprets the skinsensations as body related but as images projected into the space beingexplored by the bodily directed “gaze” of the video camera. Thus to experience“real objects out there,” the person must actively direct the camera (by heador hand). 

Another sensory modalitywhere the relation between perception and action can be seen is olfaction. Overmany years of research, Walter Freeman has managed to insert an array ofelectrodes into the olfactory bulb of a rabbit so that a small portion of theglobal activity can be measured while the animal behaves freely.48 He found thatthere is no clear pattern of global activity in the bulb unless the animal isexposed to one specific odor several times. Furthermore, such emergent patternsof activity seem to be created out of a background of incoherent or chaoticactivity into a coherent attractor.[49](#49_1)As in the case of color, smell is not a passive mapping of external featuresbut a creative form of enacting significance on the basis of the animal’sembodied history. 

There is in fact growingevidence that this kind of fast dynamics can underlie the configuration ofneuronal ensembles. It has been reported in the visual cortex in cats andmonkeys linked to visual stimulation; it has been found in radically differentneural structures such as the avian brain and even the ganglia of aninvertebrate, Hermissenda.[50](#50_1)This universality is important, for it indicates the fundamental nature of thiskind of mechanism of sensorimotor coupling and hence enaction. Had this kind ofmechanism been a more species-specific process, typical of, say, only themammalian cortex, it would have been far less convincing as a working hypothesis.[51](#51_1) 

Let us now turn to theidea that cognitive structures emerge from the kinds of recurrent sensorimotorpatterns that enable action to be perceptually guided. The pioneer and giant inthis area is Jean Piaget.[52](#52_1) Piaget laid out a program that hecalled genetic epistemology: he set himself the taskof explaining the development of the child from an immature biological organismat birth to a being with abstract reason in adulthood. The child begins withonly her sensorimotor system, and Piaget wishes to understand how sensorimotorintelligence evolves into the child’s conception of an external world withpermanent objects located in space and time and into the child’s conception ofherself as both an object among other objects and as an internal mind. WithinPiaget’s system, the newborn infant is neither an objectivist nor an idealist;she has only her own activity, and even the simplest act of recognition of anobject can be understood only in terms of her own activity. Out of this, shemust construct the entire edifice of the phenomenal world with its laws andlogic. This is a clear example in which cognitive structures are shown toemerge from recurrent patterns (in Piaget’s language, “circular reactions”) ofsensorimotor activity. 

Piaget, however, as atheorist, never seems to have doubted the existence of a pregiven world and anindependent knower with a pregiven logical endpoint for cognitive development.The laws of cognitive development, even at the sensorimotor stage, are anassimilation of and an accommodation to that pregiven world. We thus have aninteresting tension in Piaget’s work: an objectivist theorist who postulateshis subject matter, the child, as an enactive agent, but an enactive agent whoevolves inexorably into an objectivist theorist. Piaget’s work, alreadyinfluential in some domains, would bear more attention from non-Piagetians. 

One of the mostfundamental cognitive activities that all organisms perform is categorization.By this means the uniqueness of each experience is transformed into the morelimited set of learned, meaningful categories to which humans and otherorganisms respond. In the behaviorist era of psychology (which was also theheyday of cultural relativism in anthropology), categories were treated asarbitrary, and categorization tasks were used in psychology only to study thelaws of learning.[53](#53_1) (The sense of arbitrariness alsoreflects the subjectivist trends in contemporary thought that emphasize theelement of interpretation in all experience.) In the enactive view, althoughmind and world arise together in enaction, their manner of arising in any particularsituation is not arbitrary. Consider the object on which you are sitting, andask yourself what it is. What is its name? If you are sitting on a chair, thechances are that you will have thought chair ratherthan furniture or armchair.Why? Rosch proposed that there was a basic level of categorization intaxonomies of concrete objects at which biology, culture, and cognitive needsfor informativeness and economy all met.[54](#54_1)In a series of experiments, Rosch et al. found the basic level ofcategorization to be the most inclusive level at whichcategory members (1) are used, or interacted with, by similar motor actions,(2) have similar perceived shapes and can be imaged, (3) have identifiablehumanly meaningful attributes, (4) are categorized by young children, and (5)have linguistic primacy (in several senses).[55](#55_1)

The basic level ofcategorization, thus, appears to be the point at which cognition andenvironment become simultaneously enacted. The object appears to the perceiveras affording certain kinds of interactions, and the perceiver uses the objectswith his body and mind in the afforded manner. Form and function, normallyinvestigated as opposing properties, are aspects of the same process, andorganisms are highly sensitive to their coordination. And the activitiesperformed by the perceiver/actor with basic-level objects are part of thecultural, consensually validated forms of the life of the community in whichthe human and the object are situated—they are basic-level activities. 

Mark Johnson proposedanother very intriguing basic categorization process.[56](#56_1)Humans, he argues, have very general cognitive structures called kinesthetic image schemas: for example, the container schema, the part-whole schema,and the source-path-goal schema. These schemasoriginate in bodily experience, can be defined in terms of certain structuralelements, have a basic logic, and can be metaphorically projected to givestructure to a wide variety of cognitive domains. Thus, the container schema’sstructural elements are “interior, boundary, exterior,” its basic logic is“inside or outside,” and its metaphorical projection gives structure to ourconceptualizations of the visual field (things go in and out of sight),personal relationships (one gets in or out of a relationship), the logic ofsets (sets contain their members), and so on. 

On the basis of adetailed study of these kinds of examples, Johnson argues that image schemasemerge from certain basic forms of sensorimotor activities and interactions andso provide a preconceptual structure to our experience. He argues that since ourconceptual understanding is shaped by experience, we also have image-schematicconcepts. These concepts have a basic logic, which imparts structure to thecognitive domains into which they are imaginatively projected. Finally, theseprojections are not arbitrary but are accomplished through metaphorical andmetonymical mapping procedures that are themselves motivated by the structuresof bodily experience. Sweetzer provides specific case studies of this processin linguistics. She argues that historical changes of meaning of words inlanguages can be explained as metaphorical extensions from the concrete andbodily relevant senses of basic-level categories and image schemas to moreabstract meanings—for example, “to see” comes to mean “to understand.”[57](#57_1) 

Focusing oncategorization, Lakoff has written a compendium of the work that various peoplehave done that can be interpreted to challenge an objectivist viewpoint.[58](#58_1) Recently Lakoff and Johnson haveproduced a manifesto of what they call an experientialist approach tocognition. This is the central theme of their approach: 

Meaningful conceptual structures arise from two sources: (1) from thestructured nature of bodily and social experience and (2) from our innatecapacity to imaginatively project from certain well-structured aspects ofbodily and interactional experience to abstract conceptual structures. Rationalthought is the application of very general cognitive processes—focusing,scanning, superimposition, figure-ground reversal, etc.—to such structures.[59](#59_1) 

This statement wouldseem consonant with the view of cognition as enaction for which we are arguing.

One provocative possibleextension of the view of cognition as enaction is to the domain of culturalknowledge in anthropology. Where is the locus of cultural knowledge such asfolktales, names for fishes, jokes—is it in the mind of the individual? In therules of society? In cultural artifacts? How can we account for the variationfound across time and across informants?[60](#60_1)Great leverage for anthropological theory might beobtained by considering the knowledge to be found in the interface betweenmind, society, and culture rather than in one or even in all of them. Theknowledge does not preexist in any one place or form but is enacted inparticular situations—when a folktale is told or a fish named. We leave it toanthropology to explore this possibility. 

### HeideggerianPsychoanalysis 

A view ofpsychopathology fundamentally different from either the Freudian approach orobject relations theory was offered by Karl Jaspers, Ludwig Binswagner, andMerleau-Ponty based on the philosophy of Heidegger.[61](#61_1)Intended to account for psychological disorders more general, morecharacterological, than the hysterical and compulsive symptomatology in whichFreudian analysis specializes, this account can be dubbed the ontological viewto contrast with Freud’s representational, cognitivist, epistemological view.[62](#62_1) In the ontological view, acharacter disorder can be understood only in terms of a person’s entire mode ofbeing in the world. A theme, such as inferiority and dominance, which isusually only one dimension among many used by an individual in defining hisworld, becomes fixated, through an early experience, such that it becomes theonly mode through which the person can experience himself in the world. Itbecomes like the light by which objects are seen—the light itself cannot beseen as an object—and thus there is no comparison possible with other modes ofbeing in the world.[63](#63_1) Existential psychoanalysis hasextended this type of analysis to pathologies other than character disorders atthe same time that it has recharacterized so-called pathologies as existentialchoices.[64](#64_1) 

The extent to which thisphenomenological portrait of pathology lacks any specific methods of its ownfor treatment is well known, however. The patient might attempt to recall theinitial incidents that produced the totalizing of one theme, enact and work throughthis theme through transference with the therapist, or undergo body work todiscover and alleviate the embodied stance of the theme—all, however, areequally characteristic of therapies in which the disorder is conceived in aFreudian, object relations, or other theoretical fashion. 

The possibilities fortotal personal reembodiment inherent in the mindful, open-ended approach toexperience that we have been describing may provide the needed framework andtools for implementation of an existential, embodied psychoanalysis. In fact,the relationship between meditation practice, Buddhist teachings, and therapyis a topic of great interest and great controversy among Westernmindfulness/awareness practitioners.[65](#65_1)Psychological therapy in the Western sense is a historically and culturallyunique phenomenon; there is no specific counterpart within traditionalBuddhism. Many Western meditators (whether they consider themselves students ofBuddhism or not) either are therapists or are considering becoming therapists,and many more have the experience of undergoing therapy. But again, we mustremind the reader of our disclaimer concerning what is said in this book aboutpsychoanalysis. An adequate discussion of this ferment would lead us too farafield at this point, but we invite the reader to consider what form areembodying psychoanalysis might take. 

## The Retreat into Natural Selection 

In preparation for thenext chapter, we now wish to take note of a prevalent view within cognitivescience, one which constitutes a challenge to the view of cognition that wehave presented so far. Consider, then, the following response to ourdiscussion: “I am willing to grant that you have shown that cognition is not simplya matter of representation but depends on our embodied capacities for action. Iam also willing to grant that both our perception and categorization of, say,color, are inseparable from our perceptually guided activity and that they areenacted by our history of structural coupling. Nevertheless, this history isnot the result of just any pattern of coupling; it is largely the result ofbiological evolution and its mechanism of natural selection. Therefore ourperception and cognition have survival value, and sothey must provide us with some more or less optimal fitto the world. Thus, to use color once more as an example, it is this optimalfit between us and the world that explains why we see the colors we do.” 

We do not mean toattribute this view to any particular theory within cognitive science. On thecontrary, this view can be found virtually anywhere within the field: in visionresearch, it is common both to the computational theory of Marr and Poggio[66](#66_1) and to the “direct theory” of J.J. Gibson and his followers.[67](#67_1) It is prevalent in virtuallyevery aspect of the philosophical project of “naturalized epistemology.”[68](#68_1) It is even voiced by those whoinsist on an embodied and experientialist approach to cognition.[69](#69_1)For this reason, this view can be said to constitute the “received view” withincognitive science of the evolutionary basis for cognition. We cannot ignore,then, this retreat into natural selection. 

Let us begin, onceagain, with our now familiar case study of color. The cooperative neuronaloperations underlying our perception of color have resulted from the longbiological evolution of the primate group. As we have seen, these operationspartly determine the basic color categories that are common to all humans. Theprevalence of these categories might lead us to suppose that they are optimalin some evolutionary sense, even though they do not reflect some pregivenworld. 

This conclusion,however, would be considerably unwarranted. We can safely conclude that sinceour biological lineage has continued, our color categories are viable or effective. Otherspecies, however, have evolved different perceivedworlds of color on the basis of different cooperative neuronal operations.Indeed, it is fair to say that the neuronal processes underlying human colorperception are rather peculiar to the primate group. Most vertebrates (fishes,amphibians, and birds) have quite different and intricate color visionmechanisms. Insects have evolved radically different constitutions associatedwith their compound eyes.[70](#70_1) 

One of the mostinteresting ways to pursue this comparative investigation is through acomparison of the dimensionalities of color vision. Our color vision is trichromatic: as we have seen, our visual system comprisesthree types of photoreceptors cross-connected to three color channels.Therefore, three dimensions are needed to represent our color vision, that is,the kinds of color distinctions that we can make. Trichromacy is certainly notunique to humans; indeed, it would appear that virtually every animal classcontains some species with trichromatic vision. More interesting, however, isthat some animals are dichromats, others are tetrachromats, and some may even be pentachromats.(Dichromats include squirrels, rabbits, tree shrews, some fishes, possiblycats, and some New World monkeys; tetrachromats include fishes that live closeto the surface of the water like goldfish, and diurnal birds like the pigeonand the duck; diurnal birds may even be pentachromats).[71](#71_1)Whereas two dimensions are needed to represent dichromatic vision, four areneeded for tetrachromatic vision (see [figure 8.6](#fig_006_1)),and five for pentachromatic vision. Particularly interesting are tetrachromatic(perhaps pentachromatic) birds, for their underlying neuronal operations appearto differ dramatically from ours.[72](#72_1)

![9739_008_fig_006.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image047.png)

[Figure 8.6](#fig_006a_1) Tetrachromatic vs.trichromatic mechanisms are illustrated here on the basis of the differentretinal pigments present in various animals. From Neumeyer, DasFarbensehen des Goldfisches. 

When people hear of thisevidence for tetrachromacy, they respond by asking, “What are the other colorsthat these animals see?” This question is understandable but naive if it istaken to suggest that tetrachromats are simply better at seeing the colors wesee. It must be remembered, though, that a four-dimensional color space isfundamentally different from a three-dimensional one: strictly speaking, the two color spaces are incommensurable, forthere is no way to map the kinds of distinctions available in four dimensionsinto the kinds of distinctions available in three dimensions without remainder.We can, of course, obtain some analogical insights into what such higherdimensional color spaces might be like. We could imagine, for example, that ourcolor space contains an additional temporal dimension. In this analogy, colorswould flicker to different degrees in proportion to the fourth dimension. Thusto use the term pink, for example, as a designator insuch a four-dimensional color space would be insufficient to pick out a singlecolor: one would have to say rapid-pink, etc. If itturns out that the color space of diurnal birds is pentachromatic (which isindeed possible), then we are simply at a loss to envision what their colorexperience could be like.[73](#73_1) 

It should now beapparent, then, that the vastly different histories of structural coupling forbirds, fishes, insects, and primates have enacted or brought forth differentperceived worlds of color. Therefore, our perceived world of color should notbe considered to be the optimal “solution” to some evolutionarily posed“problem.” Our perceived world of color is, rather, a result of one possibleand viable phylogenic pathway among many others realized in the evolutionaryhistory of living beings. 

Again, the response onthe behalf of the “received view” of evolution in cognitive science will be,“Very well, let us grant that color as an attribute of our perceived worldcannot be explained simply by invoking some optimal fit, since there is such arich diversity of perceived worlds of color. Thus the diverse neuronalmechanisms underlying color perception are not different solutions to the sameevolutionarily posed problem. But all that follows is that our analysis must bemade more precise. These various perceived worlds of color reflect variousforms of adaptation to diverse ecological niches. Each animal group optimallyexploits different regularities of the world. It is still a matter of optimalfit with the world; it is just that each animal group has its own optimal fit.”

This response is a stillmore refined form of the evolutionary argument. Although optimizations areconsidered to differ according to the species in question, the view remainsthat perceptual and cognitive tasks involve some form of optimal adaptation tothe world. This view represents a sophisticated neorealism, which has thenotion of optimization as its central explanatorytool. We cannot proceed further, then, without examining more closely this ideain the context of evolutionary explanations. We cannot attempt to summarize thestate of the art of evolutionary biology today, but we do need to explore someof its classical foundations and their modern alternatives.

They involve not only sensoryinterpretation and motor action but also the entire gamut of cognitiveexpectations and emotional tonality, which are central to the shaping of amoment of action. Between breakdown these oscillations are the symptoms of(rapid) reciprocal cooperation and competition among distinct agents that areactivated by the current situation, vying with each other for differing modesof interpretation for a coherent cognitive framework and readiness for action.On the basis of this fast dynamics, as in an evolutionary process, one neuronalensemble (one cognitive subnetwork) finally becomes more prevalent and becomesthe behavioral mode for the next cognitive moment.

# [9 ]()Evolutionary Path Making and Natural Drift 

## Adaptationism: An Idea in Transition 

The evolutionary themesthat we need to discuss actually run parallel to those we have pursued in ourdiscussion of cognition. We have seen that the notion of representation (in itsstrong version) is the centerpiece of most contemporary cognitive science.Similarly, the notion of adaptation is thecenterpiece for much of recent evolutionary biology. Many critiques of thisso-called adaptationist program have appeared inrecent years, however, resulting in a full-scale revision of what was, untilquite recently, a uniform view.[1](#1_19) 

The orthodoxy underrevision today is the theory of organic evolution in its neo-Darwinianformulation. Neo-Darwinism is to modern evolutionary theory what cognitivism isto cognitive science—in more ways than one. Like cognitivism, the neo-Darwinianprogram is relatively easy to state succinctly. 

The heritage from whichNeo-Darwinism arose was, of course, that of Darwin himself. This heritage canbe summarized in three basic points: 

1.   Evolution occurs as a gradualmodification of organisms by descent; that is, there is reproduction withheredity. 

2.  This hereditary materialconstantly undergoes diversification (mutation, recombination). 

3.  There is a central mechanism toexplain how these modifications occur: the mechanism of natural selection. Thismechanism operates by picking the designs (phenotypes) that cope with thecurrent environment most efficiently. 

This classical Darwinismbecame Neo-Darwinism during the 1930s as a result of the so-called modernsynthesis between the Darwinian ideas based on zoology, botany, and systematicson the one hand and the rising knowledge in cellular and population genetics onthe other. This synthesis established the basic view that modifications occurby small changes in organismic traits specified by heritable units, the genes.The genetic makeup responsible for the ensemble of traits leads to differentialreproduction rates, hence to changes in the genetic makeup of an animalpopulation over generations. Evolution simply is the totality of these geneticchanges in interbreeding populations. The pace and tempo of evolution aremeasured by the changes in the fitness of genes; thus it is possible to give aquantitative basis for the visible adaptation of animals to the environments inwhich they live. These concepts are, of course, ones with which we are allfamiliar. But we need to clarify them one step further to do justice to theirmultiple scientific roles. 

Consider the concept ofadaptation. The most intuitive sense of adaptation is that it is some form ofdesign or construction that matches optimally (or at least very well) somephysical situation. For example, the fins of fishes are well suited for anaquatic environment, whereas the ungulate hoof is well suited for running onthe prairies. Although this conception of adaptation is quite popular, mostprofessional evolutionary theorists do not construe adaptation in this way.Instead, adaptation has come to refer specifically tothe process that is linked to reproduction andsurvival, that is, to adapting. This process is—or soone supposes—what accounts for the apparent degree of adaptational designobserved in nature. 

To make this idea ofadapting do theoretical work, however, we need some way to analyze theadaptedness of organisms. This is where the notion of fitnesscomes in. From the vantage point of adaptedness, the task of evolution consistsin finding heritable strategies, sets of interrelated genes that will be moreor less capable of contributing to differential reproduction. When a genechanges so as to improve in this task, it improves its fitness. This idea offitness is often formulated as a measure of abundance.It is usually taken as a measure of individual abundance (as a measure of thesurplus offspring achieved), but it can also be construed as a measure of populationabundance (as the effect of genes on the rate of growth of a population). 

It has becomeincreasingly clear, however, that this way of measuring fitness as abundancehas a number of conceptual and empirical difficulties. First of all, in mostanimal groups reproductive success depends on sexual encounters with otherindividuals. Second, since the effects of any given gene are always intertwinedwith a multitude of other genes, it is not always possible to differentiate theeffects of individual genes. Third, the milieu where the genes are supposed toexpress themselves is enormously varied and time dependent. Finally, thismilieu must be seen in the context of the entire life cycle and ecology of ananimal. 

Fitness can also betaken as a measure of persistence. Here fitnessmeasures the probability of reproductive permanence over time. What isoptimized is not the amount of offspring but the probability of extinction.Clearly this approach is more sensitive to long-term effects, and so it is animprovement over the more narrow view of fitness as abundance. By the sametoken, however, it poses formidable problems at the level of measurement. 

Armed with theserefinements, the dominant orthodoxy in evolutionary thinking over the last fewdecades saw evolution as a “field of forces.”[2](#2_19)Selective pressures (the physical metaphor is fitting) act on the geneticvariety of a population, producing changes over time according to anoptimization of the fitness potential. The adaptationist or neo-Darwinianstance comes from taking this process of natural selection as the main factorin organic evolution. In other words, orthodox evolutionary theory does notdeny that there are a number of other factors operating in evolution; it simplydownplays their importance and seeks to account for the observed phenomenamainly on the basis of optimizing fitness. 

It is precisely thisorthodox, neo-Darwinian theory of evolution that is typically invoked orpresupposed in discussions of the relation between evolution and cognition andso constitutes the received view of evolution within cognitive science. Ourintention in this chapter is to embark upon a critical examination of thisorthodox view. It is important to make clear at the outset, however, that ourcriticisms will not be leveled at the scientific plausibility of theadaptationist program. It seems to us that this research program, likecognitivism, is as plausible as any other scientific enterprise. It cannot be refutedon purely logical grounds or on the basis of a few isolated observations. Wemust take some time, then, to explore the nature of the serious empiricaldifficulties that this orthodox theory faces, difficulties that have ledevolutionary biologists to enlarge their horizon to encompass alternativeaccounts and theories. 

In the next section wewill sketch some of the more important open questions and points of disputethat have motivated the development of these alternative accounts. Takentogether, these points will lead us toward a view of evolution that we shallrefer to as natural drift.[3](#3_18)Evolution as natural drift is the biological counterpart of cognition asembodied action, and therefore also provides a more embracing theoreticalcontext for the study of cognition as a biological phenomenon. 

## A Horizon of Multiple Mechanisms 

The points of disputethat we need to discuss are various and intermixed, but they all converge uponthe same fundamental limitation in the dominant interpretation of naturalselection. 

### Linkageand Pleiotropy 

Genes are clearly linkedtogether, and so it is not really possible—not even by some smart trade-off—totreat an organism as merely an array of characters or traits. The fact that thepresence of a gene does not result in the manifestation of an isolated trait,except in a few remarkable cases (such as eye color) is known to biologists as linkage and pleiotropy.Pleiotropic effects are not bizarre properties of a few exceptionally complextraits. Genic interdependence expresses the straightforward fact that thegenome is not a linear array of independent genes (manifesting as traits) but ahighly interwoven network of multiple reciprocal effects mediated throughrepressors and derepressors, exons and introns, jumping genes, and evenstructural proteins. In what other way could one even begin to explain thatthere is, for example, a genetic link between left-handedness and coeliacdisease (an intestinal irritability as a reaction to wheat protein resulting indiarrhea)?[4](#4_19) This linkage involves just aboutevery known metabolic pathway and organ operation in the body. 

Perhaps the mostdramatic cases of genomic wholeness (in macroevolution rather than ontogeny)are the drastic discontinuities in how species change over time, known as punctuated equilibria.[5](#5_19)This much-discussed idea has essentially dispensed with the idea ofevolutionary gradualism (that evolution occurs through the step-by-stepaccumulation of selected point mutations). The fossil record does not lookincomplete; intermediate forms often simply cannot be imagined. How, forexample, could one produce a transition from a species with dorso-ventralasymmetry to one with a mirror type of asymmetry? There are surely no organismsthat have all their organs collapsed in the midplane. Transitions must be amatter of global rearrangements involving cooperative effects and geneticexchanges. Such effects can be shown to appear in simple cases even in theabsence of any selection.[6](#6_18) 

Pleiotropy providesobvious difficulties for adaptationism. How can a gene be selectively optimizedif it has multiple effects, which need not increase fitness in the same manneror even in the same direction? Selection might push to decrease the frequencyof a certain gene, but pleiotropy, on the other hand, might push to increase ormaintain the gene. The net result is some compromise that cannot be describedas simply the result of selective pressures. 

As usual in science,such difficulties can be seen either as serious flaws or as details that willbe explained later. The confirmed neo-Darwinian acknowledges the existence ofgenetic interdependence but is confident that more refined techniques ofmeasurement will separate the contribution of pleiotropy from that of naturalselection, or that natural selection itself will decouple genes with oppositeeffects. Nonetheless, the fact remains that classical fitness measures of traitshave yet to provide any clear answer to the problem of pleiotropic effects. 

There are thereforereasons to ask whether the very program of studying evolution as trait fitnessoptimization is not fundamentally flawed. Instead, one could seek to studyevolution through a theoretical framework that puts a strong emphasis onorganisms and societies as integral wholes, rather than as arrays of traits—nomatter how many trade-offs one is willing to take into account.[7](#c9_note_7) 

### Development

The weakness of favoringan approach whose point of departure is a view of organisms as arrays ofindependent traits appears with renewed vengeance in considering the role ofdevelopment in the evolutionary process. The classical approach that is stillalive in most textbooks simply jumps from genes and gene frequencies tophenotypes and reproductively able organisms. The developmental stageconnecting birth to adulthood is acknowledged but immediately set aside.[8](#8_17) 

Evolutionary biologists,however, have been busy showing on their own terrain how pattern formation andmorphogenesis are highly constrained cellular choreographies that drasticallydelimit the scope of possibilities for change. In the words of a classic textby de Beer, “It has become increasingly clear from researches in embryologythat the processes whereby the structures are formed are as important as thestructures themselves from the point of view of evolutionary morphology andhomology.”[9](#9_19) 

Consider, for example,the development of the different segments in the embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila, a choice material for developmental studies(see [figure9.1](#fig_001_5)).[10](#10_18) The egg segments itselfsuccessively into committed regions giving rise to dorsal, ventral, etc. By anearly stage, the so-called blastoderm, there is a full-fledged epigenetic codefor the animal’s topography. This code defines a finite set of alternativedevelopmental decisions and a constrained set of transformations among them.For example, antennae and genitalia are quite close in this embryological grammar,a fact that coincides well with the significant number of so-called homeoticmutants that cause transformations in these distant points of the blastoderm.This model can be analyzed further through a distributed mechanism based onmorphogenetic gradients, in a manner that resembles the kind of analysispursued by connectionists. Indeed, the main point is the same: once again, onediscovers the importance of emergent properties in a complex network (whetherneural, genetic, or cellular). In the same manner, the stripes and patchcoatcolor of various mammals can be characterized by a constrained set of expectedpatterns. One example is a “spot” pattern that tends to transform distally to astripe pattern on narrowing regions such as tails.

[Figure 9.1](#fig_001a_5) Segmentation in theembryo of the fruit fly Drosophila. 

The point here is thatas embryological landscapes and genetic networks become more familiar, the mostpowerful explanatory accounts will appeal increasingly to the intrinsicself-organizing properties of such networks. These factors are, accordingly,referred to as intrinsic factors in evolution. Weshould note, however, that it is important to avoid the all-too-easy tendencyof opposing natural selection as external with developmental constraints asinternal, for this inner/outer dichotomy is not at all fruitful in attemptingto understand evolution. 

### RandomGenetic Drift 

Apart from pleiotropyand development, still another element confounds the basic logic of theadaptationist program. This is the irruption of randomness.It is widely recognized by now that there is a significant degree of random genetic drift (which is not to be confused with our idea ofevolution as natural drift) among the genetic compositions of animalpopulations. A first source of such randomness is the sheer effect ofproximity: if a gene is actively selected, it will bring along—in a“hitchhiking” effect—any others that are close enough. Since position inchromosomes is hardly linked to epigenetic effects, such proximity effects area considerable source of serendipity. 

Second, if a biologicalpopulation is maintained at a particular finite size, its gene and genotypefrequencies will “drift” from generation to generation. Such drift is due tothe fact that the genotype frequencies of parents, when filtered through thedifferential reproductive probabilities, may not be representative of thegenotype frequencies of the parents’ next generation. The next generation’sgene and genotype frequencies may diverge from those of the previous one.Therefore, even if one construes evolution as genotype changes (remember we areattempting to sketch an alternative), then evolution has occurred entirelyindependent of any selective pressure, due to what a statistician might call a“sampling error.” A number of observations have made clear that such drift isfar from marginal.[11](#11_16) Among these is the perplexingobservation that about 40 percent of the genome is not expressed and isrepetitive. This portion is accordingly known as “junk” DNA. From a classicalstandpoint, such a massive amount of genetic material is totally inactive andso simply should not be there. 

### Stasis 

Adaptation as a measureof increased progeny in a next generation might have virtually nothing to dowith long-range evolutionary permanence or with survival of an organismallineage. Zoologists are familiar with the widespread stasisof some groups—with the fact that groups not only stay around but remain withlittle changes, even though their environment has from our vantage pointchanged dramatically.[12](#12_14) 

For example, studies ofone of the more familiar groups among vertebrates, the salamanders of thefamily Plethodontidae, suggest that these organismshave persisted with little change for over fifty million years. Despite minorpigmentation and size differences, the species in this group are remarkablyuniform, especially in skeletal structure, which is the form best preserved inthe fossil record. In contrast, present members display considerable geneticdiversity in every parameter measured. All the terrestrial vertebrate generathat cooccurred with Plethodontidae sixty millionyears ago are now extinct. With regard to food sources and predator diversity,the environment has certainly changed dramatically. Yet the morphology of thisspecies has basically remained the same (though clearly the same morphology canaccommodate various different behaviors). 

Genotypic plasticity,which is at the base of evolutionary stasis, is also evident in the microbialworld where constant genetic exchange occurs side by side with an astoundingdegree of stasis. These and other observations suggest that focusing onpersistence, rather than abundance, might be a better way to approachadaptation. 

### Units of Selection 

The adaptationistprogram has also been criticized for its almost unquestioned assumption thatthe individual is the only unit of evolution and selection. In contrast,theories that emphasize multiple levels or units of selection working inparallel are entirely plausible and suggest revised interpretations of manyphenomena that have puzzled those who assume selection can operate only at theindividual level. At one extreme there is the selfish DNA hypothesis, whichviews genes themselves as the main units of selection.[13](#13_15) At the other extreme is theWynne-Edwards notion of group selection invoked to account for the maintenanceof altruistic traits.[14](#14_15) A full list of units looks ratherformidable: DNA short sequences, genes, whole gene families, the cell itself,the species genome, the individual, “inclusive” groups of genes that arecarried by different individuals, the social group, the actually interbreedingpopulation, the entire species (as a potentially interbreeding group), theecosystem of actually interacting species, and the global biosphere. Each unitharbors modes of coupling and selection constraints, has unique self-organizingqualities, and so has its own emergent status with respect to other levels ofdescription.[15](#15_14) 

We shall not attempt tosummarize this complex debate here—a debate that has proceeded so far by eachfavored level dismissing the other as nonsensical.[16](#16_15) Despite these partisan debates,the fact remains that future evolutionary theory will in one way or anotherinclude a clear articulation of various units of selection and their relations.

## Beyond the Best in Evolution and Cognition 

The above points ofcontention are sufficiently deep and critical to make the adaptationistapproach look considerably less compelling. Let us clearly state the crux ofthe matter: to explain an observed biological regularity as an optimal fit oroptimal correspondence with pregiven dimensions of the environment appears lessand less tenable on both logical and empirical grounds. As Richard Lewontinsaid in a recent critique of the classical position, “It is not that thesephenomena [developmental constraints, pleio­tropy, etc.] are not mentioned, butthey are clearly diversions from the big event, the ascent of Mount Fitness bySir Ron Fisher and his faithful Sherpas.”[17](#17_13) Increasingly, evolutionarybiologists have become engaged in a movement away from Mount Fitness toward alarger and as yet incompletely formulated new theory.[18](#18_13) Our task is to provide an outlinefrom our point of view of some of the main elements of this new emergingorientation. 

Evolutionary andcognitive issues coincide along at least two important lines, which areimplicitly active in cognitive science today: 

1.   Evolution is often invoked as anexplanation for the kind of cognition that we or other animals presently have.This idea makes reference to the adaptive value of knowledge, and it is usuallyframed along classical neo-Darwinian lines. 

2.  Evolution is often used as asource of concepts and metaphors in building cognitive theories. This tendencyis clearly visible in the proposal of so-called selective theories of brainfunction and learning. 

In either case, thecentral issue remains whether evolutionary processes can be understood by therepresentationist idea that there is a correspondence between organism andenvironment provided by the optimizing constraints ofsurvival and reproduction. Baldly stated, representationism in cognitive scienceis the precise homologue of adaptationism in evolutionary theory, foroptimality plays the same central role in each domain. It follows that anyevidence that weakens the adaptationist viewpoint ipso facto providesdifficulties for the representationist approach to cognition. 

In chapters 5 and 6 wedescribed how cognitive scientists were relentlessly led by the requirements oftheir research to the study of subnetworks that act on local scales. Thesenetworks interact with each other in tangled webs, forming societies of agents,to use Minsky’s language. It should be clear from our list of current problemsthat evolutionary theorists have reached independently much the sameconclusions. The constraints of survival and reproduction are far too weak to providean account of how structures develop and change. Accordingly, no global optimalfitness scheme apparently suffices to explain evolutionary processes. Thereare, to be sure, local genetic agents for, say, oxygen consumption or feathergrowth, which can be measured on some comparative scale where optimality may besought, but no single scale will do the job for all processes.[19](#19_13) 

The central issue can beput in the form of an analogy.[20](#20_13) John needs a suit. In a fullysymbolic and representationist world, he goes to his tailor who measures himand produces a nice suit according to the exact specifications of hismeasurements. There is, however, another obvious possibility, one that does notdemand so much from the environment. John goes to several department stores andchooses a suit that fits well from among the various ones available. Althoughthese do not suit him exactly, they are good enough, and he chooses the optimalone for fit and taste. Here we have a good selectionist alternative that usessome optimal criteria of fitness. The analogy admits, however, of furtherrefinement. John, like any human being, cannot buy a suit in isolation from therest of what goes on in his life. In buying a suit, he considers how his lookswill affect the response of his boss at work, the response of his girl friend,and he may also be concerned with political and economic factors. Indeed, thevery decision to buy a suit is not given from the outset as a problem but isconstituted by the global situation of his life. His final choice has the formof satisfying some very loose constraints (e.g., being well dressed) but doesnot have the form of a fit—and even less so of an optimal fit—to any of theseconstraints. 

With this third step inthe analogy we rejoin the types of issues being raised in evolutionary theory,as well as those in cognitive science, that involve the impossibility of simply“scaling up” from local solutions to overall performance. The analogy alsomoves us closer to the issues that have to be reformulated in a moreencompassing evolutionary theory. Let us now retake these issues in biologicaldetail. 

## Evolution:Ecology and Development in Congruence 

Part of the difficultyin moving beyond the adaptationist framework is to determine what to do afterwe abandon the idea of natural selection as the main explanation, so that everystructure, mechanism, trait, or disposition cannot be explained away by itscontribution to survival value. The temptation is to say, But then are thingsthere for no reason at all? The task in evolutionary biology is to change thelogical geography of the debate by studying the tangled, circular relations ofcongruence among the items to be explained. 

The first step is toswitch from a prescriptive logic to a proscriptive one, that is, from the ideathat what is not allowed is forbidden to the idea that what is not forbidden isallowed. In the context of evolution this shift means that we remove selectionas a prescriptive process that guides and instructs in the task of improvingfitness. In contrast, in a proscriptive context natural selection can be seento operate, but in a modified sense: selection discards what is not compatiblewith survival and reproduction. Organisms and thepopulation offer variety; natural selection guarantees only that what ensuessatisfies the two basic constraints of survival and reproduction. 

This proscriptiveorientation shifts our attention to the tremendous diversity of biologicalstructures at all levels. Indeed, one of the main points of modern biologicalthought is the way in which such a tremendous amount of diversity is not justcompatible with, but actually woven into, the basic constraint of maintaining acontinuous lineage. In fact, all the issues that we have discussed as problemsfor the adaptationist account become sources of explanation for alternativeviewpoints because they highlight the way in which the enormous diversity constantlygenerated at all levels in the genetic and evolutionary process both shapes andis shaped by the coupling with an environment. We have already seen repeatedlythat such emergent properties provide one of the main lessons from research inneuroscience and the study of self-organizing systems and nonlinear networks.Indeed, neurobiologists, developmental biologists, immunologists, and linguistsall find themselves in the position of trying to understand how so muchprofligacy is pruned to provide the substrata for various viable pathwaysrather than selected along trajectories to match a given external standard.[21](#21_13) 

The second step, then,is to analyze the evolutionary process as satisficing(taking a suboptimal solution that is satisfactory) rather than optimizing:here selection operates as a broad survival filter that admits any structurethat has sufficient integrity to persist.[22](#22_13) Given this point of view, thefocus of analysis is no longer on traits but rather on organismic patterns viatheir life history. Another metaphor recently suggested for this post-Darwinianconception of the evolutionary process is evolution as bricolage,the putting together of parts and items in complicated arrays, not because theyfulfill some ideal design but simply because they are possible.[23](#23_11) Here the evolutionary problem isno longer how to force a precise trajectory by the requirements of optimalfitness; it is, rather, how to prune the multiplicity of viable trajectoriesthat exist at any given point.[24](#24_11) 

One of the moreinteresting consequences of this shift from optimal selection to viability isthat the precision and specificity of morphological or physiological traits, orof cognitive capacities, are entirely compatible with their apparentirrelevance to survival. To state this point in more positive terms, much ofwhat an organism looks like and is “about” is completely underdeterminedby the constraints of survival and reproduction. Thus adaptation (in itsclassical sense), problem solving, simplicity in design, assimilation, external“steering” and many other explanatory notions based on considerations ofparsimony not only fade into the background but must in fact be completelyreassimilated into new kinds of explanatory concepts and conceptual metaphors. 

Let us now explicitlyarticulate the alternative to the view that we have been taking such pains tocriticize. The view that we call evolution by natural drift can be articulatedin four basic points: 

1.   The unit of evolution (at anylevel) is a network capable of a rich repertoire of self-organizingconfigurations. 

2.  Under structural coupling with amedium, these configurations generate selection, an ongoing process ofsatisficing that triggers (but does not specify) change in the form of viabletrajectories. 

3.  The specific (nonunique)trajectory or mode of change of the unit of selection is the interwoven(nonoptimal) result of multiple levels of subnetworks of selectedself-organized repertoires. 

4.  The opposition between inner andouter causal factors is replaced by a coimplicative relation, since organismand medium mutually specify each other. 

We intend this set ofarticulated mechanisms to replace the adaptationist outline that we presentedat the beginning of this chapter and to give content to our announcedalternative view. This view of evolution depends on the conjoint applicabilityof three conditions: 

1a. The richness of the self-organizing capacities in biologicalnetworks 

2a. A mode of structuralcoupling permitting the satisficing of viable trajectories 

3a. The modularity ofsubnetworks of independent processes that interact with each other by tinkering

These three conditionsare obviously not logically interdependent. Thus we can conceive of modularnetworks that couple with constraints requiring directed selection rather thansatisficing. Or we can conceive of rich networks that have histories ofsatisficing but are not modular and so do not manifest any developmentalqualities. It is therefore both interesting and remarkable that living organismsempirically satisfy these three conjoint conditions. This situation is not trueof systems in general; nor is it true as a matter of logic. It is true of thosekinds of beings that we are, namely, living systems. 

Since these ideas entaila change in our scientific views, they are of course subject to resistance.There are basically two points of resistance to the ideas presented here.First, there is resistance on the part of those who still feel close to theclassical viewpoint. Here we find a dismissal of the kinds of arguments that wehave unfolded in this chapter; they are claimed to be matters of minor detailor far-off clouds on the horizon waiting to be dispelled by more research.Second, there is a more pervasive and subtle form of resistance. Here we findagreement with our claim that evolutionary theory needs to undergo revision,yet a sufficient amount of the old view is retained, so that the revision isnot radical but merely cosmetic. In the present case, though (1a) is almostuniversally accepted in biology and cognitive science, (2a) and (3a) are stillminority positions. 

The difference for usbetween a merely partial change and the more thorough revision that we intendturns on how the notion of coupling with an environment is conceptualized. Ourclaim is that the logic of (1)–(3), when applied consistently, leads usinevitably to (4). Let us consider this issue more closely. 

According to traditionalwisdom, the environment in which organisms evolve and that they come to know isgiven, fixed, and unique. Here again we find the idea that organisms arebasically parachuted into a pregiven environment. This simplistic viewundergoes refinement when we allow for changes in the environment, an allowancethat was already empirically familiar to Darwin. Such a moving environmentprovides the selective pressures that form the backbone of neo-Darwinianevolutionary theory. 

In moving towardevolution as natural drift, however, we introduce a further step: we recastselective pressures as broad constraints to be satisfied. The crucial pointhere is that we do not retain the notion of an independent, pregivenenvironment but let it fade into the background in favor of so-called intrinsicfactors. Instead, we emphasize that the very notion of what an environment iscannot be separated from what organisms are and what they do. This point hasbeen made quite eloquently by Richard Lewontin: “The organism and theenvironment are not actually separately determined. The environment is not astructure imposed on living beings from the outside but is in fact a creationof those beings. The environment is not an autonomous process but a reflectionof the biology of the species. Just as there is no organism without anenvironment, so there is no environment without an organism.”[25](#25_11) 

The key point, then, isthat the species brings forth and specifies its own domain of problems to besolved by satisficing; this domain does not exist “out there” in an environmentthat acts as a landing pad for organisms that somehow drop or parachute intothe world. Instead, living beings and their environments stand in relation toeach other through mutual specification or codetermination. Thus what we describe as environmentalregularities are not external features that have been internalized, as representationism and adaptationism both assume.Environmental regularities are the result of a conjoint history, a congruencethat unfolds from a long history of codetermination. In Lewontin’s words, theorganism is both the subject and the object of evolution.[26](#26_11) 

We cannot emphasize thispoint too strongly, for the temptation in the movement toward anonadaptationist evolutionary view is to retain the organism and environment asseparate poles and then to attempt to determine the “proportion” that is playedby each—a bit of intrinsic factors plus a bit of external constraints. Thismode of breaking down the dynamics of evolution, however, simply will not do,for it forces upon us all the supposedly outdated problems of the innate versusthe acquired, nature versus nurture. But as Susan Oyama has so insightfullyanalyzed, this supposedly dead issue of nature versus nurture will actually refuseto go away unless we learn to see organisms and environments as mutuallyunfolded and enfolded structures.[27](#27_8)In Oyama’s words, 

Form emerges in successive interaction. Far from being imposed on matterby some agent, it is a function of the reactivity of matter at manyhierarchical levels, and of the responsiveness of those interactions to eachother. Because mutual selectivity, reactivity, and constraint take place onlyin actual processes, it is these that orchestrate the activity of differentportions of DNA, that make genetic and environmental influences interdependentas genes and gene products are environments to each other, as extraorganismalenvironment is made internal by psychological or biochemical assimilation, asinternal state is externalized through products and behavior that select andorganize the surrounding world.[28](#28_9) 

Genes are, then, betterconceived as elements that specify what in the environment must be fixed forsomething to operate as a gene, that is, to be predictably correlated with aresult. In every successful reproduction an organism passes on genes as well asan environment in which these genes are embedded. We see features of thisenvironment, such as sunlight or oxygen, as independent of the organism onlybecause our frame of reference is relative. The interconnectedness of theworld, however, says otherwise. Once again, the world is not a landing pad intowhich organisms parachute: nature and nurture stand in relation to each otheras product and process. 

What all this means is not that genes and environment are necessary forall characteristics, inherited or acquired (the usual enlightened position),but that there is no intelligible distinction between inherited (biological,genetically based) and acquired (environmentally mediated) characteristics …Once the distinction between the inherited and the acquired has beeneliminated, not only as extremes but even as a continuum, evolution cannot besaid to depend on the distinction. What is required for evolutionary change isnot genetically encoded as opposed to acquired traits, but functioningdevelopmental systems: ecologically embedded genomes.[29](#29_8)

Lewontin and Oyama areexemplary for their understanding of this crucial point. By and largebiologists have not thought through this point with the rigor and consistencyit demands. The reason, of course, is that if we take this mutual enfoldmentview of life and world seriously, it initially results in a sense of vertigodue to the collapse of what we had supposed to be sure and stable foundations.But rather than sweeping this sense of groundlessness under the rug by onceagain pitching the internal and the external against each other (which wealready know will not work), we need to delve deeper into this sense ofgroundlessness and follow through all of its implications, philosophically andexperientially. 

We should also take noteof recent theories that approach neural cognitive mechanisms in selectiveDarwinian terms.[30](#30_9) In our terms, these theoriesincorporate not just (1a) but also argue in various degrees for (2a) and (3a).Sometimes these so-called selectionist theories follow through the implicationsof these points to embrace the fully coimplicative nature of organism andenvironment. For example, Gerald Edelman, a leading exponent of suchselectionist theories, expressed to a reporter in a recent interview, “You andthe world are embedded together.”31 Nevertheless, it is not always clear to what extentselectionists are willing to let go of the objectivist convictions that oftenlinger in their writings. 

## Lessonsfrom Evolution as Natural Drift 

In the previous chapterwe argued that perception consists in perceptually guided action and thatcognitive structures emerge from the recurrent sensorimotor patterns thatenable action to be perceptually guided. We summarized this view by saying thatcognition is not representation but embodied action and that the world wecognize is not pregiven but enacted through our history of structural coupling.

We then raised anobjection in the form of the view that perceptual and cognitive processesinvolve various optimal adaptations to the world. It was this objection thatprompted our excursion into evolutionary biology in this chapter. What lessons,then, can we draw from this excursion? 

Let us return, onceagain, to our favored example of color. When we last left this cognitivedomain, we had seen that there are different, incommensurable “color spaces”:some require only two dimensions for their description (dichromacy), somerequire three (trichromacy), others require four (tetrachromacy), perhaps evenfive (pentachromacy). Each of these different kinds of color space is enactedor brought forth through a specific history of structural coupling. 

One of our motives inthis chapter has been to show how such unique histories of coupling can beunderstood from the vantage point of evolution. To this end, we have provided acritique of the adaptationist view of evolution as a process of (more-or-less) progressivefitness, and we have articulated an alternative view of evolution as naturaldrift. We claim, then, that these unique histories of coupling, which enactincommensurable kinds of color space, should not be explained as optimaladaptations to different regularities in the world. Instead, they should beexplained as the result of different histories of natural drift. Furthermore,since organism and environment cannot be separated but are in fact codeterminedin evolution as natural drift, the environmental regularities that we doassociate with these various color spaces (for example, surface reflectances)must ultimately be specified in tandem with the perceptually guided activity ofthe animal. 

Let us provide anotherexample from the comparative study of color vision. It is well known that honeybees are trichromats whose spectral sensitivity is shifted toward theultraviolet.[32](#32_7) It is also well known thatflowers have contrasting reflectance patterns in ultraviolet light. Considernow our “chicken-and-egg” question from the previous chapter: Which came first,the world (ultraviolet reflectance) or the image (ultraviolet sensitivevision)? Most of us would probably answer with little hesitation, The world(ultraviolet reflectance). It is therefore interesting to observe that thecolors of flowers appear to have coevolved with theultraviolet sensitive, trichromatic vision of bees.[33](#33_5)

Why should suchcoevolution occur? On the one hand, flowers attract pollinators by their foodcontent and so must be both conspicuous and yet different from flowers of otherspecies. On the other hand, bees gather food from flowers and so need torecognize flowers from a distance. These two broad and reciprocal constraintsappear to have shaped a history of coupling in which plant features and thesensorimotor capacities of bees coevolved. It is this coupling, then, that isresponsible for both the ultraviolet vision of bees and the ultravioletreflectance patterns of flowers. Such coevolution therefore provides anexcellent example of how environmental regularities are not pregiven but arerather enacted or brought forth by a history of coupling. To quote Lewontin oncemore, 

[Our central nervoussystems are not fitted to some absolute laws of nature, but to laws of natureoperating within a framework created by our own sensuous activity. Our nervoussystem does not allow us to see the ultraviolet reflections from flowers, but abee’s central nervous system does. And bats “see” what nighthawks do not. We donot further our understanding of evolution by general appeal to “laws ofnature” to which all life must bend. Rather, we must ask how, within thegeneral constraints of the laws of nature, organisms have constructedenvironments that are the conditions for their further evolution andreconstruction of nature into new environments.]()[34](#34_5) 

This insistence on thecodetermination or mutual specification of organism and environment should notbe confused with the more commonplace view that different perceiving organismssimply have different perspectives on the world. This view continues to treatthe world as pregiven; it simply allows that this pregiven world can be viewedfrom a variety of vantage points. The point we are making, however, isfundamentally different. We are claiming that organism and environment aremutually enfolded in multiple ways, and so what constitutes the world of agiven organism is enacted by that organism’s history of structural coupling.Furthermore, such histories of coupling proceed not through optimal adaptationbut rather through evolution as natural drift. 

The treatment of theworld as pregiven and the organism as representing or adapting to it is adualism. The extreme opposite of dualism is a monism. We are not proposingmonism; enaction is specifically designed to be a middle way between dualismand monism. The one example of a virtually monistic system that has beenproposed is the “ecological approach” of J. J. Gibson and his followers.[35](#35_5) It will be instructive to explorethe difference between our middle-way emphasis on the codetermination of animaland environment with the Gibsonian approach. Since this point is important, wewill conclude this section by taking several paragraphs to clarify thedifferences. 

Gibson’s theory hasessentially two distinct features. The first is compatible with our approach toperceptually guided action. Gibson claims that in the study of perception theworld must be described in a way that shows how it constitutes environments forperceiving animals. In Gibson’s view, certain properties are found in the environmentthat are not found in the physical world per se. The most significantproperties consist in what the environment affords for the animal, which Gibsoncalls affordances. Stated in precise terms,affordances consist in the opportunities for interaction that things in theenvironment possess relative to the sensorimotor capacities of the animal. Forexample, relative to certain animals, some things, such as trees, are climbableor afford climbing. Thus affordances are distinctly ecological features of theworld. 

Second, Gibson offers aunique theory of perception to explain how the environment is perceived. Heargues that there is sufficient information in the ambient light to specify theenvironment directly, that is, without the mediation of any kind ofrepresentation (symbolic or subsymbolic). In more precise terms, hisfundamental hypothesis is that there are invariances in the topology of theambient light that directly specify properties of the environment, includingaffordances. 

This second element—whichactually defines the Gibsonian research program—is not compatible with ourapproach to perceptually guided action. This point is easy to miss because bothapproaches deny the representationist view of perception in favor of the ideathat perception is perceptually guided action. In Gibson’s view, however,perceptually guided action consists in “picking up” or “attending to”invariances in the ambient light that directly specify their environmentalsource. For Gibson, these optical invariances, as well as the environmentalproperties they specify, do not depend in any way upon the perceptually guidedactivity of the animal (though Gibson’s followers do relativize them to a givenanimal niche).[36](#36_5) Thus Gibson writes, “Invariancecomes from reality, not the other way round. Invariance in the ambient opticarray over time is not constructed or deduced; it is there to be discovered.”37 Similarly, heclaims, “The observer may or may not perceive or attend to the affordance,according to his needs, but the affordance, being invariant is always there tobe perceived.”[38](#38_3) 

In a nutshell, then,whereas Gibson claims that the environment is independent, we claim that it isenacted (by histories of coupling). Whereas Gibson claims that perception isdirect detection, we claim that it is sensorimotor enactment. Thus theresulting research strategies are also fundamentally different: Gibsonianstreat perception in largely optical (albeit ecological) terms and so attempt tobuild up the theory of perception almost entirely from the environment. Ourapproach, however, proceeds by specifying the sensorimotor patterns that enableaction to be perceptually guided, and so we build up the theory of perceptionfrom the structural coupling of the animal. 

One other point deservesmention. It might be thought that perception as direct detection is compatiblewith the perceived world as enacted. The idea here would be that since ourperceived world is enacted through our history of coupling, it does not need tobe re-presented and so can be directly perceived. Some Gibsonians appear toargue for something resembling this idea when they claim that the “mutuality”of animal and environment grounds the notion of direct perception.[39](#39_3) Their idea is that given a properaccount of animal-environment mutuality, we do not need to invoke any kind ofrepresentational item (symbolic or subsymbolic) that would mediate or standbetween animal and environment; therefore, perception is direct. 

We believe that thisidea results from the mistaken assumption that animal-environment mutuality issufficient for direct perception. From the fact, however, that there is amutuality between animal and environment—or in our terms that the two arestructurally coupled—it simply does not follow that the act of perceiving isdirect in the Gibsonian sense of “responding” or “resonating” to opticalinvariants. Of course, this latter Gibsonian claim is a substantive empiricalhypothesis and so does not stand or fall on the basis of logicalconsiderations. Nevertheless, our point is that this claim represents only oneway of explicating the relation between perceptually guided action andanimal-environment mutuality. We disalign ourselves with this explicationbecause we believe it leads to a research strategy in which one attempts tobuild an ecological theory of perception entirely from the side of theenvironment. Such an attempt neglects not only the structural unity (autonomy)of the animal but also the codetermination of animal and environment that wehave gone to such great lengths to stress.[40](#40_3)

## Defining the Enactive Approach 

As we can nowappreciate, to situate cognition as embodied action within the context ofevolution as natural drift provides a view of cognitive capacities asinextricably linked to histories that are lived, muchlike paths that exist only as they are laid down in walking. Consequently,cognition is no longer seen as problem solving on the basis of representations;instead, cognition in its most encompassing sense consists in the enactment orbringing forth of a world by a viable history of structural coupling. 

It should be noted thatsuch histories of coupling are not optimal; they are, rather, simply viable.This difference implies a corresponding difference in what is required of acognitive system in its structural coupling. If this coupling were to beoptimal, the interactions of the system would have to be (more or less)prescribed. For coupling to be viable, however, the perceptually guided actionof the system must simply facilitate the continuing integrity of the system(ontogeny) and/or its lineage (phylogeny). Thus once again we have a logic thatis proscriptive rather than prescriptive: any action undertaken by the systemis permitted as long as it is does not violate the constraint of having tomaintain the integrity of the system and/or its lineage. 

Yet another way to express this idea would be to say that cognition asembodied action is always about or directed toward something that is missing:on the one hand, there is always a next step for the systemin its perceptually guided action; and on the other hand, the actions of thesystem are always directed toward situations thathave yet to become actual. Thus cognition as embodied action both poses theproblems and specifies those paths that must be tread or laid down for theirsolution. 

This formulation alsoprovides us with a way of specifying the aboutness or intentionality ofcognition as embodied action. It should be recalled that, in general,intentionality has two sides: first, intentionality includes how the systemconstrues the world to be (specified in terms of the semantic content ofintentional states); second, intentionality includes how the world satisfies orfails to satisfy this construal (specified in terms of the conditions ofsatisfaction of intentional states).[41](#41_3)We would say that the intentionality of cognition as embodied action consistsprimarily in the directedness of action. Here the two-sidedness ofintentionality corresponds to what the system takes its possibilities for actionto be and to how the resulting situations fulfill or fail to fulfill thesepossibilities.[42](#42_3) 

What does thisreconceptualization of the intentionality of cognition imply in more pragmaticterms for cognitive science? Consider that there are two domains in which wecan describe any cognitive system: on the one hand, we can focus on thestructure of the system by describing it as composed of various subsystems,etc., and on the other hand, we can focus on the behavioral interactions of thesystem by describing it as a unity capable of various forms of coupling. Inswitching back and forth between these two kinds of description, we—that is,cognitive scientists—must determine both how the environment constrains thesystem and how these constraints themselves are specified by the sensorimotorstructure of the system (recall the quotation from Merleau-Ponty in theprevious chapter). In so doing, we are able to explain howregularities—sensorimotor and environmental—emerge from structural coupling.The research task in cognitive science is to make transparent the mechanisms bywhich such coupling actually unfolds and thereby how specific regularitiesarise. Many theoretical elements are already in place (emergent properties innetwork behaviors, natural drift in lineages of reproductive organisms,developmental switches, etc.); many others remain to be specified. 

We are now ready toformulate in precise terms the enactive approach in cognitive science. Let usanswer, then, the same questions that we addressed to cognitivism and to theemergence program. 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

Enaction: A history of structural coupling that brings forth a world. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through a network consisting of multiple levels of interconnected,sensorimotor subnetworks. 

 

Question 3: 

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

[Answer: ]()

When it becomes part of an ongoing existing world (as the young ofevery species do) or shapes a new one (as happens in evolutionary history). 

Much that appears inthese answers has hitherto been absent from cognitive science—not just fromcognitivism but from present-day, state-of-the-art connectionism. The mostsignificant innovation is that since representations no longer play a centralrole, the role of the environment as a source of input recedes into thebackground. It now enters in explanations only on those occasions when systemsundergo breakdowns or suffer events that cannot be satisfied by theirstructures. Accordingly, intelligence shifts from being the capacity to solve aproblem to the capacity to enter into a shared world of significance. 

At this point, however,the pragmatic reader might be somewhat impatient: “All this fuss about enactionas opposed to representation is fine, but what realdifference does it make, say, in artificial intelligence and robotics? Ifsomething like the enactive approach begins to affect the way engineers buildcognitive artifacts, then I’ll pay attention.” 

We take this kind ofpragmatic response quite seriously. Indeed, we have stressed from the veryfirst chapter that cognitive science cannot be separated from cognitivetechnology. Thus we do not offer the enactive approach as a refined,European-flavored position that has no hands-on applications in cognitivescience. On the contrary, we claim that without the key notions of the enactiveapproach, cognitive science will be unable both to account for living cognitionand to build truly intelligent, cognitive artifacts. We will now consider howthe enactive approach can affect hands-on research in cognitive science,especially robotics and artificial intelligence. 

## EnactiveCognitive Science 

In general withinenactive cognitive science a process akin to evolution as natural drift takesthe place of task-oriented design. For example, simulations of prolongedhistories of coupling with various evolutionary strategies enable us todiscover trends wherein cognitive performances arise.[43](#43_3)Such a strategy is feasible in all areas of cognitive science—provided that weare willing to relax the constraints of some specific problem-solvingperformance. This willingness does in fact appear to be increasing in recentresearch. (Thus consider the development of so-called classifier systems, whichare designed to confront an undefined environment that must be shaped intosignificance.)[44](#44_3) Our discussion will focus onrecent developments in the field of robotics, that is, the attempt to developmobile and intelligent artifacts, which is increasingly found at the center ofAI research. 

Like connectionism, thefield of robotics has gradually begun to appreciate that much early pioneeringwork in the cybernetic era was—contrary to the received cognitivist history—onthe right track after all. Thus a recent popular book acknowledges theimportance of this early work, especially that of Gray Walter and Ross Ashbywho built machines that could be autonomous and operate in ordinary humanenvironments.[45](#45_3) Let us take a closer look at anexplicitly formulated research strategy that harkens back to this earlier erabut also takes the further step of formulating within robotics research aprogram akin to our enactive orientation. 

The research to which werefer is that of Rodney Brooks in the AI laboratory at MIT.[46](#46_3)On the first page of his paper, “Intelligence withoutRepresentation,” Brooks presents his approach: 

In this paper I … argue for a different approach to creating ArtificialIntelligence: 

·     We must incrementally build up thecapabilities of intelligent systems at each step of the way and thusautomatically ensure that the pieces and their interfaces are valid. 

·     At each step we should buildcomplete intelligent systems that we let loose in the real world with realsensing and real action. Anything less provides a candidate with which we candelude ourselves. 

We have been following this approach and have built a series ofautonomous mobile robots. We have reached an unexpected conclusion (C) and have a rather radical hypothesis (H). 

C: When we examine verysimple level intelligence we find that explicit representations and models ofthe world simply get in the way. It turns out to be better to use the world asits own model. 

H: Representation is thewrong unit of abstraction in building the bulkiest parts of intelligentsystems. 

Representation has been the central issue in Artificial Intelligencework over the last 15 years only because it has provided an interface betweenotherwise isolated modules and conference papers. 

It is interesting tonote that in this paper Brooks also traces the origin of what he describes asthe “deception of Al” to the tendency in AI for abstraction, for factoring outperception and motor skills. As we have argued here, however, and as Brooksargues for his own reasons, such abstraction misses the essence ofintelligence, which resides only in its embodiment. 

Brooks’s goal is tobuild “completely autonomous robots, mobile agents that co-exist in the worldwith humans, and are seen by those humans as intelligent beings in their ownright.”[47](#47_3) His key move in working towardthis goal is not the usual decomposition of a system by functionbut rather a novel decomposition by activity (see [figure 9.2](#fig_002_4)).In his words, 

![9739_009_fig_002.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image051.png)

[Figure 9.2](#fig_002a_4) Behavior-baseddecomposition. From Brooks, Achieving artificial intelligence through buildingrobots. 

[An alternativedecomposition makes no distinction between peripheral systems, such as vision,and central systems. Rather the fundamental slicing up of an intelligent systemis in the orthogonal direction dividing it into activityproducing subsystems. Each activity, or behavior, producing system individuallyconnects sensing to action. We refer to an activity producing system as a layer [see ]()[figures 9.2](#fig_002_4) and [9.3](#fig_003_4)]. An activity is a pattern of interactions with the world. Anothername for our activities might well be skillemphasizing that each activity can at least post facto be rationalized aspursuing some purpose. We have chosen the word activity however because ourlayers must decide when to act for themselves, not be some subroutine to beinvoked at the beck and call of some other layer. … 

![9739_009_fig_003.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image053.png)

[Figure 9.3](#fig_003a_4) Finite statemachines are wired together into layers of control. Each layer is built on topof existing layers. Lower levels never rely on the existence of higher-levellayers. From Brooks, Intelligence without representation. 

The idea is to first build a very simple complete autonomous system,and test it in the real world. Our favorite exampleof such a system is a Creature, actually a mobile robot, which avoids hittingthings. It senses objects in its immediate vicinity and moves away from them,halting if it senses something in its path. It is still necessary to build thissystem by decomposing it into parts, but there need be no clear distinctionbetween a “perception subsystem,” a “central system” and an “action system.” Infact there may well be two independent channels connecting sensing to action(one for initiating motion, and one for emergency halts), so there is no singleplace where “perception” delivers a representation of the world in thetraditional sense.[48](#c9_note_48) 

It is, of course, of theutmost significance that Brooks insists that there are no representationsinvolved in the layers of his Creatures. Instead, each individual layer simplyspecifies or makes evident those aspects of the Creature’s world that arerelevant. Equally significant is that his Creatures haveno central system. Instead, the layers carry out their activities on their own;the compatibility of the layers gives rise to a sense of purpose only in theeyes of the observers: “Out of the local chaos of their interactions thereemerges, in the eye of an observer, a coherent pattern of behavior.”[49](#49_3) 

The implementation ofthis “decomposition by activity” has yielded so far a succession of four mobilerobots in which layer is superimposed upon layer, thereby making the autonomousbehavior of the Creature more and more interesting (see [figure 9.3](#fig_003_4)). These robots are all Creatures in thesense that on power-up they are viable in any world in which they are letloose. Brooks’s hope is to reach the level of insect intelligence (a truelandmark in Brooks’s view) within two years by building a Creature composed offourteen layers. Thus Brooks’s strategy stands in sharp contrast to theclassical approach, where robots or other AI artifacts are given specificgoals, tasks, or plans. 

The pragmatist bent onhaving immediate results tomorrow might be frustrated with this approach. We,however, are willing to bet with Brooks that in the relatively short term,perhaps a few years, such artifacts will have evolved into generations ofsufficiently intelligent Creatures whose efficacy can begin to be exploited. Webelieve that this fully enactive approach to AI is one of the most promisingavenues of research available today, but it needs to be given a chance byappreciating its possibilities in a context that is not limited to concern withshort-term applications. 

This example of what weare calling enactive AI is distinctively and clearly formulated as such by itsproponents (of course, they do not use our term enactive).As Brooks himself states, his approach is neither connectionism nor productionrules nor hermeneutics. It is motivated by the same good old engineeringconcerns that gave us both cognitivism and connectionism. It is precisely theseengineering concerns that reveal most clearly how the notion of cognition asenaction is being generated by the very logic of research and development inpresent-day cognitive science. The enactive approach, then, is no merephilosophical preference but the result of forces internal to research incognitive science, even in the case of those hard-nosed engineers who desire tobuild truly intelligent and useful machines. 

The replacement oftask-oriented design by cognitive modeling that is closer to evolution asnatural drift also has implications for the relations between the emergence andenactive approaches. Here the issue turns on how we construe what a distributednetwork can do. If we emphasize how historical processes lead to emergentregularities without fixed and final constraints, then we recover the moreopen-ended biological condition. On the other hand, if we emphasize how a givennetwork acquires a very specific capacity in a very definite domain (forexample, NetTalk), then representations return, and we have the more typicaluse of connectionist models. 

Consider as an examplePaul Smolensky’s harmony theory. Smolensky’s paradigm of subsymboliccomputation is generally compatible with the concerns of the enactive program.The remaining point of difference consists in Smolensky’s evaluation of hismodels by reference to an unviolated level of environmental reality. Thus onthe one hand, exogenous features in the task domain correspond to pregivenfeatures of the world, and on the other hand, endogenous activity in thenetwork acquires through experience an abstract meaning that optimally encodesenvironmental regularity. The goal is to find endogenous activity thatcorresponds to an optimality characterization of the surroundings. The enactiveprogram, on the other hand, would require that we eschew any form of optimalfitness by taking this kind of cognitive system into a situation whereendogenous and exogenous features are mutually definitory over a prolongedhistory that requires only a viable coupling. 

The road we take, then,depends strongly on the degree of interest we have in staying close tobiological reality, at the expense, perhaps, of short-term engineeringapplications. It is, of course, always possible to define a fixed domain withinwhich a connectionist system can function, but this approach obscures thedeeper issues about the biological embodiment of cognition that are so centralto the enactive program. Thus just as connectionism grew out of cognitivisminspired by closer contact with the brain, theenactive program takes a further step in the same direction to encompass thetemporality of cognition as lived history, whether seen at the level of theindividual (ontogeny), the species (evolution), or social patterns (culture). 

## InConclusion 

This enactive program,which remains removed from the predominantly objectivist/subjectivist mood ofmost contemporary science, would have been mere heterodoxy only a few yearsago. Today, however, the inner logic of research in cognitive psychology,linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, evolutionary theory, andimmunology seems to incorporate more and more working elements of an enactiveorientation. We have developed in some detail the situation in the field ofrobotics, not because we think such engineering products are the final resultof this scientific orientation but rather to make it clear that in any concreteresearch program even the most pragmatic levels are touched. This is not theplace to develop other areas that illustrate the same ideas at work. The debateis now heatedly on its way, and so researchers will no doubt subscribe tovarious intermediate positions and draw somewhat different epistemologicalconclusions. Nevertheless, these debates indicate that an enactive program isno longer the property of a few eccentric researchers but rather an alive and diverseresearch program that continues to grow. 

We have now reached theend of our presentation of the enactive approach in cognitive science. We haveseen not only that cognition is embodied action, and so inextricably tied tohistories that are lived, but also that these lived histories are the result ofevolution as natural drift. Thus our human embodiment and the world that isenacted by our history of coupling reflect only one of many possibleevolutionary pathways. We are always constrained by the path we have laid down,but there is no ultimate ground to prescribe the steps that we take. It isprecisely this lack of an ultimate ground that we have evoked at various pointsin this book by writing of groundlessness. This groundlessness of laying down apath is the philosophical issue that remains to be addressed.

[V ]()Worlds without Ground 

# [10 ]()The Middle Way 

## Evocations of Groundlessness 

Our journey has nowbrought us to the point where we can appreciate that what we took to be solidground is really more like shifting sand beneath our feet. We began with ourcommon sense as cognitive scientists and found that our cognition emerges from thebackground of a world that extends beyond us but that cannot be found apartfrom our embodiment. When we shifted our attention away from this fundamentalcircularity to follow the movement of cognition alone, we found that we coulddiscern no subjective ground, no permanent and abiding ego-self. When we triedto find the objective ground that we thought must still be present, we found aworld enacted by our history of structural coupling. Finally, we saw that thesevarious forms of groundlessness are really one: organism and environment enfoldinto each other and unfold from one another in the fundamental circularity thatis life itself. 

Our discussion ofenactive cognition points directly toward the heart of our concerns in thischapter and the next. The worlds enacted by various histories of structuralcoupling are amenable to detailed scientific investigation, yet have no fixed,permanent substrate or foundation and so are ultimately groundless. We must nowturn to face directly this groundlessness of which we have had multipleevocations. If our world is groundless, how are we to understand our day-to-dayexperience within it? Our experience feels given, unshakable, and unchangeable.How could we not ex­perience the world as independent and well grounded? Whatelse could experience of the world mean? 

Western science andphilosophy have brought us to the point where we are faced with, in the wordsof the philosopher Hilary Putnam, “the impossibility of imagining what credible‘foundations’ might look like,”[1](#1_21) but they have not provided any wayfor us to develop direct and personal insight into the groundlessness of ourown experience. Philosophers may think that this task is unnecessary, but thisis largely because Western philosophy has been more concerned with the rationalunderstanding of life and mind than with the relevance of a pragmatic methodfor transforming human experience. 

Indeed, it is largely agiven in contemporary philosophical debate that whether the world ismind-dependent or mind-independent makes little difference, if any, to oureveryday experience. To think otherwise would be to deny not only “metaphysicalrealism” but empirical, everyday commonsense realism, which is absurd. But thiscurrent philosophical assumption confuses two very different senses that theterm empirical realism can have. On the one hand, itmight mean that our world will continue to be the familiar one of objects andevents with various qualities, even if we discover that this world is notpregiven and well grounded. On the other hand, it might mean that we willalways experience this familiar world as if it were ultimately grounded, thatwe are “condemned” to experience the world as if it had a ground, even thoughwe know philosophically and scientifically that it does not. This lattersupposition is not innocent, for it imposes an a priori limitation on thepossibilities for human development and transformation. It is important to seethat we can contest this supposition without calling into question the firstsense in which things can be said to be real and independent. 

The reason this point is important is that our historical situationrequires not only that we give up philosophical foundationalism but that welearn to live in a world without foundations. Science alone—that is, sciencewithout any bridge to everyday human experience—is incapable of this task. AsHilary Putnam incisively remarks in a recent work, “Science is wonderful atdestroying metaphysical answers, but incapable of providing substitute ones.Science takes away foundations without providing a replacement. Whether we wantto be there or not, science has put us in the position of having to livewithout foundations. It was shocking when Nietzsche said this, but today it iscommonplace; our historical position—and no end to itis in sight—is that of having to philosophize without ‘foundations’.”[2](#2_21) 

Although it is true thatour historical situation is unique, we should not draw the conclusion that westand alone in the attempt to learn to live without foundations. To interpretour situation in this way would immediately prevent us from recognizing thatother traditions have, in their own ways, addressed this very issue of the lackof foundations. In fact, the problematic of groundlessness is the focal pointof the Madhyamaka tradition. With one or two exceptions, Western philosophershave yet to draw on the resources of this tradition. Indeed, one often gets theimpression that Western philosophers are not simply unfamiliar with Madhyamakabut that they suppose a priori that our situation is so unique that no otherphilosophical tradition could be relevant. Richard Rorty, for example, afterthoroughly criticizing the project of foundationalism in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, offers in its place aconception of “edifying philosophy” whose guiding ideal is “continuing theconversation of the West.”[3](#3_20) Rorty does not even pause toconsider the possibility of there being other traditions of philosophicalreflection that might have addressed his very concerns. In fact, it is one suchimportant tradition, the Madhyamaka, which has served as the basis for ourthought in this book.[4](#4_21) 

## Nagarjunaand the Madhyamaka Tradition 

Hitherto we have spokenof the Buddhist tradition of mindfulness/awareness as though it were all oneunified tradition. And in fact, the teachings of no-self—the five aggregates,some form of mental factor analysis, and karma and the wheel of conditionedorigination—are common to all of the major Buddhist traditions. At this point,however, we come to a split. The teaching of emptiness (sunyata), which we areabout to explore, according to the Buddhist tradition itself as well as toscholarship, did not become apparent until approximately 500 years after theBuddha’s death, at which time the Prajnaparamita andother texts that expound this doctrine began to appear. During those 500 years,the Abhidharma tradition had become elaborated into eighteen different schoolsthat debated each other about various subtle points and debated the manynon-Buddhist schools within Hinduism and Jainism. Those who adopted the newerteachings called themselves the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) and designated thosewho continued to adhere to the earlier teachings the Lesser Vehicle(Hinayana)—an epithet to this day widely loathed by non-Mahayanists. One of theeighteen original schools, the Theravada (the speech of the elders) hassurvived with great vigor in the modern world; it is the undisputed form ofBuddhism in the countries of Southeast Asia—Burma, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos,and Thailand. Theravada Buddhism does not teach sunyata. Sunyata is, however,the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism (the form that spread to China, Korea, andJapan) and of the Vajrayana, the Buddhism of Tibet. 

In approximately thefirst half of the second century CE, the Prajnaparamita teachings were put intoa form of philosophical argument by Nagarjuna (according to some Mahayanaschools and many, but not all, Western scholars).[5](#5_21)Nagarjuna’s stature in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism is enormous. His methodwas to work solely by means of refutation of the positions and assertions ofothers. His followers soon split into those whocontinued this method, which is very demanding for the listener as well as forthe speaker (the Prasangikas) and those who made positive arguments aboutemptiness (Svatantrikas). 

The Madhyamakatradition, although it delighted in debate and logical argument, is not to betaken as abstract philosophy in the modern sense. For one thing, the debate wasconsidered so meaningful in the social context of the courts and universitiesof early India that the losing side in a debate was expected to convert. Moreimportant, the philosophy was never to be divorced from meditation practice orfrom the daily activities of life. The point was to realize egolessness inone’s own experience and manifest it in action to others. Texts discussing thephilosophy included meditation manuals for how to contemplate, meditate, andact on the topic. 

In exposition ofNagarjuna in the present day, there is a split between Buddhist practitioners(including traditionally trained practitioner scholars) and Western academicscholars. Practitioners say that Western scholars are making up issues,interpretations, and confusions that have nothing to do with the texts or withBuddhism. Western scholars feel that the opinions (and teachings) of“believers” are not an appropriate source for textual exegesis. Since in thisbook we wish to bring into contact the living tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation with the living tradition of phenomenology andof cognitive science, for our exposition of the Madhyamaka we will draw fromthe practitioner as well as from the scholarly side of this interestingsociological detente. 

Sunyata literally means “emptiness” (sometimes misleadingly translated as “thevoid” or “voidness”). In the Tibetan tradition, it is said that sunyata may beexpounded from three perspectives—sunyata with respect to codependent arising,sunyata with respect to compassion, and sunyata with respect to naturalness. Itis the first of these, sunyata with respect to codependent arising, that mostnaturally fits with the logic we have been exploring in the discovery ofgroundlessness and its relationship to cognitive science and the concept ofenaction. 

Nagarjuna’s most wellknown work is the Stanzas of the Middle Way (Mulamadhyamakakarikas). From the perspective that we willnow examine, it carries through the logic of codependent arising to its logicalconclusion. 

In the Abhidharmaanalysis of consciousness, each moment of experience takes the form of aparticular consciousness that has a particular object to which it is tied byparticular relations. For example, a moment of seeing consciousness is composedof a seer (the subject) who sees (the relation) a sight (the object); in amoment of anger consciousness, the one who is angry (the subject) experiences(the relation) anger (the object). (This is what we have calledprotointentionality.) The force of the analysis was to show that there was notruly existing subject (a self) continuing unchangingly through a series ofmoments. But what of the objects of consciousness? And what of the relations?The Abhidharma schools had assumed that there were material properties thatwere taken as objects by five of the senses—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,and touching—and that there were thoughts that were taken as an object by themind consciousness. Such an analysis is still partially subjectivist/objectivistbecause (1) many schools, such as the basic element analysis discussed inchapters 4 and 6, took moments of consciousness as ultimate realities, and (2)the external world had been left in a relatively unproblematic, objectivist,independent state. 

The Mahayana traditiontalks about not just one but two senses of ego-self: ego of self and ego ofphenomena (dharmas). Ego of self is the habitual grasping after a self that wehave been discussing. Mahayanists claim that the earlier traditions attacked thissense of self but did not challenge the reliance on an independently existingworld or the mind’s (momentary) relations to that world. Nagarjuna attacks theindependent existence of all three terms—the subject, the relation, and theobject. What follows will be a (synthetically constructed) example of the kindof argument that Nagarjuna makes.[6](#6_20)

What is it that we mean when we say that the one who sees existsindependently or when we say that that which is seen exists independently?Surely we mean that the one who sees exists even when she is not seeing thesight; she exists prior to and/or after seeing the sight. And likewise we meanthat the sight exists prior to and/or after it is seen by the seer. That is, ifI am the seer of a sight and I truly exist, it means that I can walk away andnot see that sight—I can go hear something or think something instead. And ifthe sight truly exists, it should be able to stay there even when I am notseeing it—for example, it could have someone else see it at a future moment. 

Upon closer examination,however, Nagarjuna points out that this makes little sense. How can we talkabout the seer of a sight who is not seeing its sight? Conversely how can wespeak of a sight that is not being seen by its seer? Nor does it make any senseto say that there is an independently existing seeing going on somewherewithout any seer and without any sight being seen. The very position of a seer,the very idea of a seer, cannot be separated from the sights it sees. And viceversa, how can the sight that is being seen be separated from the seer thatsees it? 

We might try a negativetack and reply that all this is true and that the seer does not exist prior tothe sight and the seeing of it. But then how can a nonexistent seer give riseto an existing seeing and an existing sight? Or if we try to argue the otherway round and say that the sight didn’t exist until the seer saw it, the replyis, How can a nonexistent sight be seen by a seer? 

Let us try the argumentthat the seer and the sight arise simultaneously. In that case, they are eitherone and the same thing, or they are different things. If they are one and thesame thing, then this cannot be a case of seeing, since seeing requires thatthere be one who sees, a sight, and the seeing of the sight. We do not say thatthe eye sees itself. Then they must be two separate, independent things. But inthat case, if they are truly independent things, each existing in its own rightindependently of the relations in which it happens to figure, then there couldbe many relations beside seeing between them. But it makes no sense to say thata seer hears a sight; only a hearer can hear a sound. 

We might give in andagree that there is no truly existent independent seer, sight, or seeing butclaim that all three put together form a truly existent moment of consciousnessthat is the ultimate reality. But if you add one nonexistent thing to anothernonexistent thing, how can you say that that makes a truly existent thing?Indeed, how can you say that a moment of time is a truly existent thing when tobe truly existent, it would have to exist independently of other moments in thepast and future? Furthermore, since one moment is but an aspect of time itself,that moment would have to exist independently of time itself (this is anargument about the codependence of things and their attributes); and timeitself would have to exist independently of that one moment. 

At this point, we mightbe seized with the terrible feeling that indeed these things do not exist. Butsurely it makes even less sense to assert that a nonexistent seer either seesor does not see a nonexistent sight at a nonexistent moment than to make theseclaims about an existent seer. (That this argument has actual psychologicalforce is illustrated by an Israeli joke: Man 1 says, “Things are getting worseand worse; better never to have existed at all.” Man 2 says, “How true. But whoshould be so lucky?—one in ten thousand!”) Nagarjuna’s point is not to say thatthings are nonexistent in an absolute way any more than to say that they areexistent. Things are codependently originated; they are completely groundless. 

Nagarjuna’s argumentsfor complete codependence (or more properly his arguments against any otherconceivable view than codependence) are applied to three main classes oftopics: subjects and their objects, things and their attributes, and causes andtheir effects.[7](#7_19) By these means, he disposes of theidea of noncodependent existence for virtually everything—subject and objectfor each of the senses; material objects; the primal elements (earth, water,fire, air, and space); passion, aggression, and ignorance; space, time, andmotion; the agent, his doing, and what he does; conditions and outcomes; theself as perceiver, doer, or anything else; suffering; the causes of suffering,cessation of suffering, and the path to cessation(known as the Four Noble Truths); the Buddha; and nirvana. Nagarjuna finallyconcludes, “Nothing is found that is not dependently arisen. For that reason,nothing is found that is not empty.”[8](#8_19)

It is important toremember the context within which these arguments are employed. Nagarjuna’sarguments fasten on psychologically real habits of mind and demonstrate theirgroundlessness within the context of mindfulness/awareness meditation andAbhidharma psychology. A modern philosopher might believe himself able to findfaults with Nagarjuna’s logic. Even if this were the case, however, it wouldnot overturn the epistemological and psychological force of Nagarjuna’sargumentation within the context of his concerns. In fact, Nagarjuna’sarguments can be summarized in a way that makes this point apparent: 

1.   If subjects and their objects,things and their attributes, and causes and their effects exist independentlyas we habitually take them to, or exist intrinsically and absolutely as basicelement analysis holds, then they must not depend on any kind of condition orrelation. This point basically amounts to a philosophical insistence on themeanings of independent, intrinsic, and absolute. By definition, something is independent,intrinsic, or absolute only if it does not depend on anything else; it musthave an identity that transcends its relations. 

2.  Nothing in our experience can befound that satisfies this criterion of independence or ultimacy. The earlierAbhidharma tradition had expressed this insight as dependent coarising: nothingcan be found apart from its conditions of arising, formation, and decay. In ourmodern context this point is rather obvious when considering the causes andconditions of the material world and is expressed in our scientific tradition.Nagarjuna took the understanding of codependence considerably further. Causesand their effects, things and their attributes, and the very mind of theinquiring subject and the objects of mind are each equallycodependent on the other. Nagarjuna’s logic addresses itself penetratingly tothe mind of the inquiring subject (recall our fundamental circularity), to theways in which what are actually codependent factors are taken by that subjectto be the ultimate founding blocks of a supposed objective and a supposedsubjective reality. 

3.  Therefore, nothing can be foundthat has an ultimate or independent existence. Or to use Buddhist language,everything is “empty” of an independent existence, for it is codependentlyoriginated. 

We now have a contextfor understanding emptiness with respect to codependent origination: all thingsare empty of any independent intrinsic nature. This may sound like an abstractstatement, but it has far-ranging implications for experience. 

We explained in chapter4 how the categories of the Abhidharma were both descriptions and contemplativedirectives for the way the mind is actually experienced when one is mindful. Itis important to realize that Nagarjuna is not rejecting the Abhidharma, as heis sometimes interpreted as doing in Western scholarship.[9](#9_21)His entire analysis is based on the categories of the Abhidharma: what sensewould arguments such as that of the seer, the sight, and the seeing have exceptin that context? (If the reader thinks that Nagarjuna’s argument is alinguistic one, that is because he has not seen the force of the Abhidharma.)It is a very precise argument, not just a general handwaving that everything isdependent on everything. Nagarjuna is extending the Abhidharma, but thatextension makes an incisive difference to experience. 

Why should it make anydifference at all to experience? One might say, So what if the world and theself change moment to moment—whoever thought that they were permanent? And sowhat if they are mutually dependent on each other—whoever thought they wereisolated? The answer (as we have seen throughout the book) is that as onebecomes mindful of one’s own experience, one realizes the power of the urge tograsp after foundations—to grasp the sense of foundation of a real, separateself, the sense of foundation of a real, separate world, and the sense offoundation of an actual relation between self and world. 

It is said that emptiness is a natural discovery that one would make byoneself with sufficient mindfulness/awareness—natural but shocking. Previouslywe have been talking about examining the mind with meditation. There may nothave been a self, but there was still a mind to examine itself, even if amomentary one. But now we discover that we have no mind; after all, a mind mustbe something that is separate from and knows the world. We also don’t have aworld. There is neither an objective nor subjective pole. Nor is there anyknowing because there is nothing hidden. Knowing sunyata (more accuratelyknowing the world as sunyata) is surely not an intentional act. Rather (to usetraditional imagery), it is like a reflection in a mirror—pure, brilliant, butwith no additional reality apart from itself. As mind/world keeps happening inits interdependent continuity, there is nothing extra on the side of mind or onthe side of world to know or be known further. Whatever experience happens isopen (Buddhist teachers use the word exposed),perfectly revealed just as it is. 

We can now see whyMadhyamaka is called the middle way. It avoids the extreme of eitherobjectivism or subjectivism, of absolutism or nihilism. As is said by theTibetan commentators, “Through ascertaining the reason—that all phenomena aredependent arisings—the extreme of annihilation (nihilism) is avoided, andrealization of dependent-arising of causes and effects is gained. Throughascertaining the thesis—that all phenomena do not inherently exist—the extremeof permanence (absolutism) is avoided, and realization of the emptiness of allphenomena is gained.”[10](#10_20) 

But what does all thismean for the everyday world? I still have a name, a job, memories, and plans.The sun still rises in the morning, and scientists still work to explain that.What of all this? 

## TheTwo Truths 

The Abhidharma analysisof the mind into basic elements and mental factors already contained within itthe distinction between two kinds of truth: ultimate truth, which consisted ofthe basic elements of existence into which experience could be analyzed, andrelative or conventional truth, which was our ordinary, compounded (out of basicelements) experience. Nagarjuna invoked this distinction, gave it new meaning,and insisted on its importance. 

The teaching of the doctrine by the Buddha is based upon two truths:the truth of worldly convention (samvrti) and the ultimate, supreme truth (paramartha).

Those who do not discern the distinction between these two truths, donot understand the profound nature of the Buddha’s teaching (XXIV: 8–9). 

Relative truth (samvrti,which literally means covered or concealed) is the phenomenal world just as itappears—with chairs, people, species, and the coherence of those through time.Ultimate truth (paramartha) is the emptiness of that very same phenomenalworld. The Tibetan term for relative truth, kundzop,captures the relation between the two imagistically; kundzopmeans all dressed up, outfitted, or costumed—that is, relative truth is sunyata(absolute truth) costumed in the brilliant colors of the phenomenal world. 

By now it should beobvious that the distinction between the two truths, like the analysis of theAbhidharma, was not intended as a metaphysical theory of truth. It is adescription of the experience of the practitioner who experiences his mind, itsobjects, and their relation as codependently originated and thus as empty ofany actual, independent, or abiding existence. Like the Abhidharma categories,the description also functions as a recommendation and contemplative aid. Thiscan be seen very clearly in the discourse of Buddhist communities. For example,many of the forms that Westerners take as poetry orirrationality in Zen are actually contemplative exercises directing the mindtoward codependent emptiness. 

The term for relativetruth, samvrti, is also often translated as“convention” (within Buddhism as well as by academic scholars), which givesrise to much interpretative confusion. It is important to understand in whatsense convention is meant. “Relative” or “conventional” should not be taken ina superficial sense. Convention does not mean subjective, arbitrary, orunlawful. And relative does not mean culturally relative. The relativephenomenal world was always taken to operate by very clear laws regardless ofthe conventions of any individual or society, such as the laws of karmic causeand effect. 

Furthermore, it is veryimportant to understand that the use of convention here is not an invitation todecenter the self and/or world into language as is so popular at present in thehumanities. As the founder of the Gelugpa lineage in Tibetan Buddhism puts it,“… since nominally designated things are artificial, that is, established asexistent in conventional terms, there is no referent to which names areattached which (itself) is not established as merely conventionally existent.And since that is not to say that in general there is no phenomenal basis forusing names, the statement of the existence of that (conventional referent) andthe statement that (all things) are mere nominal designations are notcontradictory.”[11](#11_18) Thus in Buddhism one canperfectly well make distinctions in the relative world between true statementsand false ones, and it is recommended that one make true ones. 

The sense in which thethings designated, as well as the designations, are only conventional may beexplained by an example: when I call someone John, Ihave the deep assumption that there is some abiding independent thing that I amdesignating, but Madhyamaka analysis shows there to be no such truly existingthing. John, however, continues to act just the way a perfectly good designatumis supposed to, so in relative or conventional truth he is indeed John. Thisclaim may remind the reader of our discussion of color. Although the experienceof color can be shown to have no absolute ground either in the physical worldor the visual observer, color is nonetheless a perfectly commensurabledesignable. Thus such scientific analysis can perfectly well be joined by thefar more radical presentation of groundlessness in the Madhyamaka. 

Because this relative,conventional, codependently originated world is lawful, science ispossible—just as possible as daily life. In fact, perfectly functionalpragmatic science and engineering are possible even when they are based ontheories that make unjustifiable metaphysical assumptions—just as daily lifecontinues coherently even when one believes in the actual reality of oneself.We offer the vision of enactive cognitive science and of evolution as naturaldrift neither as a claim that this is the only way science can be done nor as aclaim that this is the very same thing as Madhyamaka. Concepts such asembodiment or structural coupling are concepts and assuch are always historical. They do not convey that at this verymoment—personally—one has no independently existing mind and no independentlyexisting world. 

This is a cruciallyimportant point. There is a powerful reason why some Madhyamaka schools onlyrefute the arguments of others and refuse to make assertions. Any conceptualposition can become a ground (a resting point, a nest), which vitiates theforce of the Madhyamaka. In particular, the view of cognition as embodiedaction (enaction), although it stresses the interdependence of mind and world,tends to treat the relationship between those (the interaction, the action, theenaction) as though it had some form of independent actual existence. As one’smind grasps the concept of enaction as something real and solid, itautomatically generates a sense of the other two terms of the argument, thesubject and object of the embodied action. (As we shall discuss, this is whypragmatism is also not the same thing as the middle way of Madhyamaka.) Wewould be doing a great disservice to everyone concerned—mindfulness/awarenesspractitioners, scientists, scholars, and any other interested persons—were weto lead anyone to believe that making assertions about enactive cognitivescience was the same thing as allowing one’s mind to be experientiallyprocessed by the Madhyamaka dialectic, particularlywhen this is combined with mindfulness/awareness training. But just as theMadhyamaka dialectic, a provisional and conventional activity of the relativeworld, points beyond itself, so we might hope that our concept of enactioncould, at least for some cognitive scientists and perhaps even for the moregeneral milieu of scientific thought, point beyond itself to a truerunderstanding of groundlessness. 

## Groundlessnessin Contemporary Thought 

We began this chapter byevoking the sense of loss of foundations in contemporary science andphilosophy. In particular, we cited one important trend in contemporaryAnglo-American thought based on a revival of pragmatist philosophy.[12](#12_16) In Europe—particularly France,Germany, and Italy—an analogous critique of foundations has been pursued,largely as a result of the continuing influence of Nietzsche and Heidegger—atrend that includes both poststructuralism[13](#13_17) and postmodern thought.[14](#14_17) The Italian philosopher GianniVattimo describes this trend as “weak thought” (pensierodebole)—that is, a kind of thought that wouldgive up the modernist quest for foundations, yet without criticizing this questin the name of another, truer foundation.[15](#15_16) Vattimo defends the positivepossibilities of this trend in the introduction to a recent work: 

The ideas of Nietzsche and Heidegger, more than any others, offer usthe chance to pass from a purely critical and negative description of thepost-modern condition … to an approach that treats it as a positive possibilityand opportunity. Nietzsche mentions all of this—although not altogetherclearly—in his theory of a possibly active, or positive, nihilism. Heideggeralludes to the same thing with his idea of a Verwindungof metaphysics which is not a critical overcoming in the ‘modern’ sense of theterm. … In both Nietzsche and Heidegger, what I have elsewhere called the“weakening” of Being allows thought to situate itself in a constructive mannerwithin the post-modern condition. For only if we take seriously the outcome ofthe “destruction of ontology” undertaken by Heidegger, and before him byNietzsche, is it possible to gain access to the positive opportunities for thevery essence of man that are found in post-modern conditions of existence. Itwill not be possible for thought to live positively in that trulypost-metaphysical era as long as man and Being are conceived of—metaphysically,Platonically, etc.—in terms of stable structures. Such conceptions requirethought and existence to “ground” themselves, or in other words to stabilizethemselves (with logic or with ethics), in the domain of non-becoming and arereflected in a whole-scale mythization of strong structures in every field ofexperience. This is not to say that everything in such an era will be acceptedas equally beneficial for humanity; but the capacity to choose and discriminatebetween the possibilities that the post-modern condition offers us can bedeveloped only on the basis of an analysis of post-modernity that captures itsown innate characteristics, and that recognizes post-modernity as a field ofpossibility and not simply as a hellish negation of all that is human.[16](#16_17) 

It is thus clear thatour contemporary world has become highly sensitized to the issue ofgroundlessness for a number of reasons in history, politics, art, science, andphilosophical reflection. We certainly cannot delve into these developmentshere. We do find remarkable, however, the extent to which the Westerntradition, based on the reasoning of philosophy and scientific practices, andthe Buddhist tradition and thought, based on experiencing the world withmindfulness/awareness, have converged. Nevertheless this convergence might be atrompe l’oeil; indeed many meditation practitioners would argue that the veryappearance of similarity of the two traditions is spurious. In this regard, wewish to point out what we believe are three major differences between thecontemporary sense of groundlessness and that of Madhyamaka. Then in the nextand final chapter we will consider the ethical dimensions of groundlessness. 

### The Lack of an Entre-deux 

In the first place,contemporary Western views have been unable to articulate together the loss offoundations for the self and for the world. There is no methodological basisfor a middle way between objectivism and subjectivism (both forms ofabsolutism). In cognitive science and in experimental psychology, thefragmentation of the self occurs because the field is trying to bescientifically objective. Precisely because the self is taken as an object,like any other external object in the world, as an object of scientificscrutiny—precisely for that reason—it disappears from view. That is, the veryfoundation for challenging the subjective leaves intact the objective as afoundation. In an exactly analogous fashion, challenges to the objective statusof the world depend upon leaving the subjective unproblematical. To espousethat an organism’s (or scientist’s) perception is never entirely objectivebecause it is always influenced by past experience and goals—the scientist’stop-down processes—is precisely the result of taking an independent subject asgiven and then discovering and arguing from the subjective nature of his representations.

Nowhere is slight ofhand between the inner and the outer more evident than in the work of DavidHume, whose classic passage on his inability to observe a self we have alreadyquoted. Hume also noted that there was a contradiction between his idea thatouter bodies (the outer world) have a “continued and distinct existence” andhis sense impressions of bodies that were discontinuous. In his contemplationof this issue, he suggests that the idea of a continuous external world (likethat of a continuous self) is a psychological construction: “There being herean opposition betwixt the notion of the identity of resembling perceptions, andthe interruption of their appearance, the mind must be uneasy in thatsituation, and will naturally seek relief from the uneasiness. … In order tofree ourselves from this difficulty, we disguise, as much as possible, theinterruption, or rather remove it entirely, by supposing that these interruptedperceptions are connected by a real existence, of which we are insensible.”[17](#17_15) The interesting point for ourpresent purposes is that there is no evidence that Hume ever thought to puttogether his empiricist doubts about the self and about the world. He had all theintellectual materials needed for an entre-deux, but with neither anintellectual tradition to suggest it nor an experiential method to discover it,he never considered the possibility. 

Our final example is aparticularly telling one as it comes from the heart of cognitive scienceitself. What does a modern cognitivist do if his experience does lead him toapproach the entre-deux—the fact that lived experience of the world is actuallybetween what we think of as the world and what we think of as the mind? Hetakes flight into theory—the current scientific milieu gives him no otheroption. We are thinking of Jackendoff, a sensitive phenomenologist who seemedled to construct the pièce de résistance of his book, the intermediate-leveltheory of consciousness, out of his perception of the betweenness of thephenomenological mind: 

On the one hand, intuition suggests that awareness reveals what isgoing on in the mind, including thought. On the other hand, intuition suggeststhat awareness reveals what is going on out in the world, that is, the resultof sensation or perception. According to the Intermediate-Level Theory, itreveals neither. Rather, awareness reflects a curious amalgam of the effects onthe mind of both thought and the real world, while leaving totally opaque themeans by which these effects come about. It is only bydeveloping a formal theory of levels of representation that we couldhave come to suspect the existence of a part of the computational mind that hasthese characteristics [our emphasis].[18](#18_15)

### Interpretationism

One of the mostseductive forms of subjectivism in contemporary thought is the use made of theconcepts of interpretation, whether by pragmatists or hermeneuticists. To itscredit, interpretationism provides a penetrating critique of objectivism thatis worth pursuing in some detail. To be objective, the interpretationist pointsout, one would have to have some set of mind-independent objects to bedesignated by language or known by science. But can we find any such objects?Let us look at an extended example from the philosopher Nelson Goodman. 

A point in space seemsto be perfectly objective. But how are we to define the points of our everydayworld? Points can be taken either as primitive elements, as intersecting lines,as certain triples of intersecting planes, or as certain classes of nestingvolumes. These definitions are equally adequate, and yet they are incompatible:what a point is will vary with each form of description. For example, only inthe first “version,” to use Goodman’s term, will a point be a primitiveelement. The objectivist, however, demands, “What are points really?” Goodman’sresponse to this demand is worth quoting at length: 

If the composition of points out of lines or of lines out of points isconventional rather than factual, points and lines themselves are no less so. …If we say that our sample space is a combination of points, or of lines, or ofregions, or a combination of combinations of points, or lines, or regions, or acombination of all these together, or is a single lump, then since none isidentical with any of the rest, we are giving one among countless alternativeconflicting descriptions of what the space is. And so we may regard thedisagreements as not about the facts but as due to differences in theconventions—adopted in organizing or describing the space. What, then, is theneutral fact or thing described in these different terms? Neither the space (a) as an undivided whole nor (b)as a combination of everything involved in the several accounts; for (a) and (b) are but two among thevarious ways of organizing it. But what is it that isso organized? When we strip off as layers of convention all differences amongways of describing it, what is left? The onion ispeeled down to its empty core.[19](#19_15) 

The appearance of theword empty here is of interest. Contemporaryphilosophy is replete with such examples of how things are empty of anyintrinsic identity because they depend on forms of designation. Hilary Putnamhas even devised a theorem in formal semantics to show that there can be nounique mapping between words and the world: even if we know the conditionsunder which sentences are true, we cannot fix the way their terms refer.[20](#20_15) Putnam concludes that we cannotunderstand meaning if we hold on to the idea that there is some privileged setof mind-independent objects to which language refers. Instead, he writes,“‘Objects’ do not exist independently of conceptual schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one oranother scheme of description. Since the objects andthe signs are alike internal to the scheme ofdescription, it is possible to say what matches what.”[21](#c10_note_21) 

Interestingly, Putnamargues not only that we cannot understand meaning if we suppose language refersto mind-independent objects; he also argues against the very notion ofproperties that exist intrinsically (i.e., nondependently), a notion that liesat the basis of objectivism: “The problem with the ‘Objectivist’ picture of theworld … [t]he deep systemic root of the disease, I want to suggest, lies in thenotion of an ‘intrinsic’ property, a property something has ‘in itself,’ apartfrom any contribution made by language or the mind.”[22](#22_15) Putnam argues that this classicalidea, combined with contemporary scientific realism, leads to the completedevaluation of experience, for virtually all of the features of our life-worldbecome mere “projections” of the mind. The irony of this stance—which we shouldnonetheless expect from our discussion of the Cartesian anxiety—is that itbecomes indistinguishable from idealism, for it makes the lived world a resultof subjective representation. 

Yet despite this thorough critique of objectivism, the argument isnever turned the other way round. Mind-independent objects are challenged, butobject-independent minds never are. (It is actually more obvious andpsychologically easier to attack the independence of objects than of minds.)The interpretationists—pragmatist or otherwise—also do not challenge thegroundedness of the concepts and interpretations themselves; rather, they takethese as the ground on which they stand. This is far from an entre-deux and farfrom Madhyamaka. 

### Transformative Potential 

When contemporarytraditions of thought discover groundlessness, it is viewed as negative, abreakdown of an ideal for doing science, for establishing philosophical truthwith reason, or for living a meaningful life. Enactive cognitive science and,in a certain sense, contemporary Western pragmatism require that we confrontthe lack of ultimate foundations. Both, while challenging theoreticalfoundations, wish to affirm the everyday lived world. Enactive cognitivescience and pragmatism, however, are both theoretical; neither offers insightinto how we are to live in a world without foundations. In the Madhyamakatradition, on the other hand, as in all Buddhism, the intimation of egolessnessis a great blessing; it opens up the lived world as path, as the locus forrealization. Thus Nagarjuna writes, “Ultimate truth cannot be taught apart fromeveryday practices. Without understanding the ultimate truth, freedom (nirvana)is not attained” (XXIV: 10). On the Buddhist path, one needs to be embodied toattain realization. Mindfulness, awareness, and emptiness are not abstractions;there has to be something to be mindful of, aware of, and to realize theemptiness of (and as we will see in chapter 11, to realize the intrinsicgoodness of and to be compassionate for). One’s very habitual patterns of grasping,anxiety, and frustration are the contents of mindfulness and awareness. Therecognition that those are empty of any actual existence manifests itselfexperientially as an ever-growing openness and lack of fixation. Anopen-hearted sense of compassionate interest in others can replace the constantanxiety and irritation of egoistic concern. 

In early Buddhism,freedom was equated with escape from samsara (the everyday lived world offixation, habit, and suffering) to the unconditional realm of nirvana. With theteaching of emptiness in the Mahayana, a radical change occurred. Nagarjunaputs it, 

There is no distinction at all between the everyday world (samsara) andfreedom (nirvana). There is no distinction at all between freedom and theeveryday world. 

The range of the everyday world is the range of freedom. Between themnot even the most subtle difference can be found. (XXV: 19, 20) 

Freedom is not the sameas living in the everyday world conditioned by ignorance and confusion; it isliving and acting in the everyday world with realization. Freedom does not meanescape from the world; it means transformation of our entire way of being, ourmode of embodiment, within the lived world itself. 

This stance is not aneasy one for anyone to understand—in cultures where Buddhism flourishes letalone in the modern world. We think that the denial of an ultimate ground istantamount to the denial of there being any ultimate truth or goodness aboutour world and experience. The reason that we almost automatically draw thisconclusion is that we have not been able to disentangle ourselves from theextremes of absolutism and nihilism and to take seriously the possibilitiesinherent in a mindful, open-ended stance toward human experience. These twoextremes of absolutism and nihilism both lead us away from the lived world; inthe case of absolutism, we try to escape actual experience by invoking foundationsto supply our lives with a sense of justification and purpose; in the case ofnihilism, failing in that search, we deny the possibility of working with oureveryday experience in a way that is liberating and transformative.

# [11 ]()Laying Down a Path in Walking 

## Science and Experience in Circulation 

In the preface weannounced that the theme of this book would be the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience. In this final chapter we wish tosituate this circulation within a wider contemporary context. In particular wewish to consider some of the ethical dimensions of groundlessness in relationto the concern with nihilism that is typical of much post-Nietzschean thought.This is not the place to consider the many points that animate current NorthAmerican and European discussions; our concern, rather, is to indicate how wesee our project in relation to these discussions and to suggest furtherdirections for investigation. 

The back-and-forthcommunication between cognitive science and experience that we have exploredcan be envisioned as a circle. The circle begins with the experience of thecognitive scientist, a human being who can conceive of a mind operating withouta self. This becomes embodied in a scientific theory. Emboldened by the theory,one can discover, with a disciplined, mindful approach to experience, thatalthough there is constant struggle to maintain a self, there is no actual selfin experience. The natural scientific inquisitiveness of the mind then queries,But how can there seem to be a coherent self when there is none? For an answerone can turn to mechanisms such as emergence and societies of mind. Ideallythat could lead one to penetrate further into the causal relationships in one’sexperience, seeing the causes and effects of ego grasping and enabling one to beginto relax the struggle of ego grasping. As perceptions, relationships, and theactivity of mind expand into awareness, one might have insight into thecodependent lack of ultimate foundations either for one’s mind or for itsobjects, the world. The inquisitive scientist then asks, How can we imagine,embodied in a mechanism, that relation of codependence between mind and world?The mechanism that we have created (the embodied metaphor of groundlessness) isthat of enactive cognition, with its image of structural coupling through ahistory of natural drift. Ideally such an image can influence the scientificsociety and the larger society, loosening the hold of both objectivism andsubjectivism and encouraging further communication between science and experience,experience and science. 

The logic of thisback-and-forth circle exemplified the fundamental circularity in the mind ofthe reflective scientist. The fundamental axis of this circulation is theembodiment of experience and cognition. It should be recalled that embodimentin our sense, as for Merleau-Ponty, encompasses both the body as a lived,experiential structure and the body as the context or milieu of cognitivemechanisms. Thus in the communication we have portrayed in this book betweencognitive science and the tradition of mindfulness/awareness, we havesystematically juxtaposed the descriptions of experience taken frommindfulness/awareness practice with descriptions of cognitive architecturetaken from cognitive science. 

Like Merleau-Ponty, wehave emphasized that a proper appreciation of this twofold sense of embodimentprovides a middle way or entre-deux between the extremes of absolutism andnihilism. Both of these two extremes can be found in contemporary cognitivescience. The absolutist extreme is easy to find, for despite other differences,the varieties of cognitive realism share the conviction that cognition isgrounded in the representation of a pregiven world by a pregiven subject. Thenihilist extreme is less apparent, but we have seenhow it arises when cognitive science uncovers the nonunity of the self yetignores the possibility of a transformative approach to human experience. 

So far we have devotedless attention to this nihilist extreme, but it is in fact far more indicativeof our contemporary cultural situation. Thus in the humanities—in art,literature, and philosophy—the growing awareness of groundlessness has takenform not through a confrontation with objectivism but rather with nihilism,skepticism, and extreme relativism. Indeed, this concern with nihilism istypical of late-twentieth-century life. Its visible manifestations are theincreasing fragmentation of life, the revival of and continuing adherence to avariety of religious and political dogmatisms, and a pervasive yet intangiblefeeling of anxiety, which writers such as Milan Kundera in TheUnbearable Lightness of Being depict so vividly. It is for this reason(and because nihilism and objectivism are actually deeply connected) that weturn to consider in more detail the nihilistic extreme. We have reserved thisissue until now because it is both general and far reaching. Our discussionmust accordingly become more centrally concerned with the ethical dimension ofgroundlessness than it has been so far. In the final section of this chapter wewill be more explicit about this ethical dimension. Before doing so, however,we wish to examine in more detail the nihilist extreme. 

## Nihilismand the Need for Planetary Thinking 

Let us begin not byattempting to engage nihilism directly but rather by asking how nihilismarises. Where and at what point does the nihilist tendency first manifestitself? 

We have been led to facegroundlessness or the lack of stable foundations in both enactive cognitivescience and in the mindful, open-ended approach to experience. In both settingswe began naively but were forced to suspend our deep-seated conviction that theworld is grounded independently of embodied perceptual and cognitivecapacities. This deep-seated conviction is the motivation for objectivism—evenin its most refined philosophical forms. Nihilism, however, is in a sense basedon no analogous conviction, for it arises initially in reaction to the loss offaith in objectivism. Nihilism can, of course, be cultivated to a point whereit takes on a life of its own, but in its first moment its form is one of response. Thus we can already see that nihilism is in factdeeply linked to objectivism, for nihilism is an extreme response to thecollapse of what had seemed to provide a sure and absolute reference point. 

We have already providedan example of this link between objectivism and nihilism when we examined thediscovery within cognitive science of selfless minds. This deep and profounddiscovery requires the cognitive scientist to acknowledge that consciousnessand self-identity do not provide the ground or foundation for cognitiveprocesses; yet she feels that we do believe, and must continue to believe, inan efficacious self. The usual response of the cognitive scientist is to ignorethe experiential aspect when she does science and ignore the scientificdiscovery when she leads her life. As a result, the nonexistence of a self thatwould answer to our objectivist representations is typically confused with thenonexistence of the relative (practical) self altogether. Indeed, without theresources provided by a progressive approach to experience, there is littlechoice but to respond to the collapse of an objective self (objectivism) byasserting the objective nonexistence of the self (nihilism). 

This response indicatesthat objectivism and nihilism, despite their apparent differences, are deeplyconnected—indeed the actual source of nihilism is objectivism. We have alreadydiscussed how the basis of objectivism is to be found in our habitual tendencyto grasp after regularities that are stable but ungrounded. In fact, nihilismtoo arises from this grasping mind. Thus faced with the discovery ofgroundlessness, we nonetheless continue to grasp after a ground because we havenot relinquished the deep-seated reflex to grasp that lies at the root ofobjectivism. This reflex is so strong that the absence ofa solid ground is immediately reified into the objectivist abyss. This act ofreification performed by the grasping mind is the root of nihilism. The mode ofrepudiation or denial that is characteristic of nihilism is actually a verysubtle and refined form of objectivism: the mere absence of an objective groundis reified into an objective groundlessness that might continue to serve as anultimate reference point. Thus although we have been speaking of objectivismand nihilism as opposed extremes with differing consequences, they ultimatelyshare a common basis in the grasping mind. 

An appreciation of thecommon source of objectivism and nihilism lies at the heart of the philosophyand practice of the middle way in Buddhism. For this reason, we are simplymisinformed when we assume that concern with nihilism is a modern phenomenon ofGreco-European origin. To appreciate the resources offered by these othertraditions, however, we must not lose sight of the specificity of our presentsituation. Whereas in Buddhism, as anywhere else, there is always the danger ofindividuals experiencing nihilism (losing heart, as it is called in Buddhism)or of commentators straying into nihilistic errors of interpretation, nihilismhas never become full blown or embodied in societal institutions. 

Today nihilism is atangible issue not only for our Western culture but for the planet as a whole.And yet as we have seen throughout this book, the groundlessness of the middleway in Mahayana Buddhism offers considerable resources for human experience inour present scientific culture. The mere recognition of this fact shouldindicate that the imaginative geography of “West” and “East” is no longerappropriate for the tasks we face today. Although we can begin from thepremises and concerns of our own tradition, we need no longer proceed inignorance of other traditions, especially of those that continually strived todistinguish rigorously between the groundlessness of nihilism and thegroundlessness of the middle way. 

Unlike Richard Rorty,then, we are not inspired in our attempt to face the issue of groundlessnessand nihilism by the ideal of simply “continuing the conversation of the West.”[1](#1_23) Instead, our project throughoutthis book owes far more to Martin Heidegger’s invocation of “planetarythinking.” As Heidegger wrote in The Question of Being,

We are obliged not to give up the effort to practice planetary thinkingalong a stretch of the road, be it ever so short. Here too no prophetic talentsand demeanor are needed to realize that there are in store for planetarybuilding encounters for which the participants are by no means equal today.This is equally true of the European and of the East Asiatic languages and,above all, for the area of a possible conversation between them. Neither one ofthe two is able by itself to open up this area and to establish it.[2](#2_23) 

Our guiding metaphor isthat a path exists only in walking, and our conviction has been that as a firststep we must face the issue of groundlessness in our scientific culture andlearn to embody that groundlessness in the openness of sunyata. One of thecentral figures of twentieth-century Japanese philosophy, Nishitani Keiji, hasin fact made precisely this claim.[3](#3_22)Nishitani is exemplary for us because he was not only raised and personallyimmersed in the Zen tradition of mindfulness/awareness but was also one ofHeidegger’s students and so is thoroughly familiar with European thought ingeneral and Heidegger’s invocation of planetary thinking in particular.Nishitani’s endeavor to develop a truly planetary form of philosophical yetembodied, progressive reflection is impressive. Let us pause to examine a fewof the essential points of his thinking. 

## NishitaniKeiji 

In our discussion of theCartesian anxiety, we saw that there is an oscillation between objectivism andsubjectivism that is linked to the concept of representation. Thusrepresentation can be construed either as the “projection” (subjectivism) or“recovery” (objectivism) of the world. (Usually, of course, both aspects ofrepresentation are incorporated in accounts of perception and cognition.) 

For Nishitani, thisoscillation between subjectivism and objectivism arises for any philosophicalstance that is based on what he calls “the field of consciousness.” With thisphrase Nishitani refers to the philosophical construal of the world as anobjective or pregiven realm and of the self as a pregiven knowing subject thatsomehow achieves contact with this pregiven world. Since consciousness is hereunderstood as subjectivity, the problem arises of how to link consciousnesswith the supposedly objective realm in which it is situated. As we have alreadydiscussed, however, the subject cannot step outside of its representations to beholdthe pregiven world as it really is in itself. Therefore given this basicallyCartesian stance, the objective becomes what is represented as such by thesubject. In Nishitani’s words, “The mode of being which is said to have riditself of its relationship to the subjective has simply been constitutedthrough a covert inclusion of a relationship to the subjective, and so cannot,after all, escape the charge of constituting a mode of being defined throughits appearance to us.”[4](#4_23)

When the notion ofobjectivity becomes problematic in this way, so too does the notion ofsubjectivity. If everything is ultimately specified through its appearance tous, then so is the knowing subject. Since the subject can represent itself toitself, it becomes an object for representation but is different from all otherobjects. Thus in the end the self becomes both an objectified subject and asubjectified object. This predicament discloses the shiftiness, the instabilityof the entire subjective/objective polarity. 

Nishitani’s next move,however, displays the deep influence of the Buddhist philosophical traditionand mindfulness/awareness practice on his thinking. He argues that to realizethe fundamental instability or groundlessness of the subjective/objectivedualism is in a sense to slip out of the “field of consciousness.” We do not“overcome” or “step out” of this dualism as if we knew in advance where we aregoing, but we do see the arbitrariness and futility of going back and forthbetween the poles of a fundamentally groundless opposition. Instead our concernshifts to the very disclosure of this groundlessness. Nishitani then followsthe pragmatic intention of mindfulness/awareness by emphasizing the existentialrole that this disclosure plays. The realization that we do not stand on solidground, that things incessantly arise and pass away without our being able topin them down to a stable objective or subjective ground, affects our very lifeand being. Within this existential context, we can be said to realize groundlessness not only in the sense of understanding but also in the sense of actualization:human life or existence turns into a question, doubt, or uncertainty. 

In Zen Buddhism, theJapanese adaptation of mindfulness/awareness in which Nishitani was raised,this uncertainty is called the “Great Doubt.” This doubt is not about anyparticular matter but is rather the basic uncertainty that arises from thedisclosure of groundlessness. Unlike the hyperbolic and hypothetical doubt ofDescartes, which is merely entertained by the subject on the field ofconsciousness, the Great Doubt points to the impermanence of existence itselfand so marks an existential transformation within human experience. This transformationconsists of a conversion away from the subjective/objective standpoint to whatis called in the English translation of Nishitani’s work the“field of nihility.” Nihility is a term used to referto groundlessness in relation to the subjective/objective polarity; it is arelative, negative notion of groundlessness that Nishitani wishes todistinguish from the groundlessness of the middle way. 

Nishitani distinguishesbetween these two kinds of groundlessness because his fundamental point is thatEuropean thought in its largely successful critique of objectivism has becometrapped in nihilism. Here Nishitani’s assessment of our situation actuallyfollows Nietzsche’s. As we mentioned in chapter 6, nihilism arises forNietzsche when we realize that our most cherished beliefs are untenable and yetwe are incapable of living without them. Nietzsche devoted considerableattention to the manifestation of nihilism in our discovery that we do notstand on solid ground, that what we take to be an absolute reference point isreally an interpretation foisted on an ever-shifting impersonal process. Hisfamous aphorism announcing “the death of God” is a dramatic statement of thiscollapse of fixed reference points. Nietzsche also understood nihilism to berooted in our craving for a ground, in our continual search for some ultimatereference point, even when we realize that none can be found: “What doesnihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim islacking; ‘why’ finds no answer.”[5](#5_23) The philosophical challenge thatNietzsche faced, which has come to characterize the task of postmodern thought,is to lay down a path of thinking and practice that gives up foundationswithout transforming itself into a search for new foundations.[6](#6_22)Nietzsche’s attempt is well known: he tried to undercut nihilism by affirminggroundlessness through his notions of eternal return and the will to power. 

Nishitani deeply admiresNietzsche’s attempt but claims that it actually perpetuates the nihilisticpredicament by not letting go of the grasping mind that lies at the souce ofboth objectivism and nihilism. Nishitani’s argument is that nihilism cannot be overcomeby assimilating groundlessness to a notion of the will—nomatter how decentered and impersonal. Nishitani’s diagnosis is even moreradical than Nietzsche’s, for he claims that the real problem with Westernnihilism is that it is halfhearted: it does not consistently follow through itsown inner logic and motivation and so stops short of transforming its partialrealization of groundlessness into the philosophical and experientialpossibilities of sunyata. The reason why Western nihilism stops short is thatWestern thought in general has no tradition that works with cognition and livedexperience in a direct and pragmatic way. (The one possible exception ispsychoanalysis, but in most of its current manifestations it has been unable toconfront the basic contradictions in our experience of the self or to offer atransformative reembodiment.) Indeed, our scientific culture has only justbegun to consider the possibility of pragmatic and progressive approaches toexperience that would enable us to learn to transform our deep-seated andemotional grasping after a ground. Without such a pragmatic approach to thetransformation of experience in everyday life—especially within our developingscientific culture—human existence will remain confined to the undecidablechoice between objectivism and nihilism. 

We should note thatNishitani’s point when he claims that Western nihilism stops short of thegroundlessness of the middle way is not that we should adopt Buddhism in thesense of a particular tradition with various cultural trappings. It is, rather,that we must achieve an understanding of groundlessness as a middle way byworking from our own cultural premises. These premises are largely determinedby science, for we live in a scientific culture. We have therefore chosen tofollow Nishitani’s lead by building a bridge between cognitive science andmindfulness/awareness as a specific practice that embodies an open-endedapproach to experience. Furthermore, since we cannot embody groundlessness in ascientific culture without reconceptualizing science itself as beyond the needof foundations, we have followed through the inner logic of research incognitive science to develop the enactive approach. This approach should serveto demonstrate that a commitment to science need not include as a premise acommitment to objectivism or to subjectivism. 

Objectivist science, byits very ideals as well as its historical context in our society, hasmaintained a role of ethical neutrality. This neutrality has been increasinglychallenged in the social discourse of our time. Theneed for planetary thinking behooves us to consider groundlessness, whetherevoked by cognitive science or experience, in its full light in the total humancontext. Is it not the self that has been considered the bearer of moral andethical potency? If we challenge the idea of such a self, what have we loosedon the world? Such a concern, we feel, is the result of the failure in Westerndiscourse to analyze the self and its product, self-interest, with experientialacumen. In contrast, the ethical dimension of ego and egolessness are at thevery heart of the Buddhist tradition. We turn now to take up, as our finalconsideration, the issue of what the mindfulness/awareness tradition might haveto offer social science for a vision of human action at its best. 

## Ethics and Human Transformation 

### TheView from Social Science 

A parable called “TheTragedy of the Commons” haunts social research on ethical concerns.[7](#7_21) The parable describes a situationin which a number of herdsmen graze their herds on a common pasturage. Eachherdsman knows that it is in his self-interest to increase the size of his herdbecause, whereas each additional animal brings profit to him, the cost ofgrazing the animal and the damage done to the pasturage is shared by all theherdsmen. As a result, each of the herdsmen rationally increases his herd sizeuntil the commons is destroyed and, with it, all of the herds that grazed onit. The concern of the social scientist is how one can get a group ofrationally self-interested herdsmen to cooperate in maintaining the vanishingcommons. 

This disarminglydisingenuous metaphor for our world situation embodies a long tradition ofmodern thought about the self and its relation to others, which may be calledthe economic view of the mind. The goal of the self is assumed to beprofit—getting the most at least cost. The unconstrained economic man,[8](#8_21) such as Hobbes’s despot,[9](#9_23) continues his acquisitions untilthere is nothing left for anyone else. Therefore, constraints are needed: overtsocial force, internalized socialization, subtle psychological mechanisms. Ageneral theory called social exchange theory, widely used in social psychology,decision theory, sociology, economics, and political science, views all ofhuman activity, individually and in groups, in terms of input and outputcalculations, paying and receiving. We believe that this implicit vision ofmotivation underlies not only social science but many contemporary people’sviews of their own action. Even altruism is defined in terms of an individualobtaining (psychological) utility from benefiting another. 

Is such a viewexperientially validated? Practitioners in the mindfulness/awareness tradition,as they begin to become mindful, are often amazed to discover the extent oftheir egotism, the increasingly subtle levels at which they find themselvesoperating with just such a business-deal mentality. They are also led toquestion whether such a stance toward the world makes sense. 

We believe that the viewof the self as an economic man, which is the view the social sciences hold, isquite consonant with the unexamined view of our own motivation that we hold asordinary, nonmindful people. Let us state that view clearly. The self is seenas a territory with boundaries. The goal of the self is to bring inside theboundaries all of the good things while paying out as few goods as possible andconversely to remove to the outside of the boundaries all of the bad thingswhile letting in as little bad as possible. Since goods are scarce, eachautonomous self is in competition with other selves to get them. Sincecooperation between individuals and whole societies may be needed to get moregoods, uneasy and unstable alliances are formed between autonomous selves. Someselves (altruists) and many selves in some roles (parents, teachers) may get(immaterial) goods by helping other selves, but they will become disappointed(even disillusioned) if those other selves do not reciprocate by being properlyhelped. 

What does themindfulness/awareness tradition or enactive cognitive science have tocontribute to this portrait of self-interest?[10](#10_22) The mindful, open-ended approachto experience reveals that moment by moment this so-called self occurs only inrelation to the other. If I want praise, love, fame, or power, there has to beanother (even if only a mental one) to praise, love, know about, or submit tome. If I want to obtain things, they have to be things that I don’t alreadyhave. Even with respect to the desire for pleasure,the pleasure is something to which I am in a relation. Because self is alwayscodependent with other (even at the gross level we are now discussing), theforce of self-interest is always other-directed in the very same respect withwhich it is self-directed. 

What, then, are peopledoing who appear so self-interested as opposed to other-interested?Mindfulness/awareness meditators suggest that those people are struggling, in aconfused way, to maintain the sense of a separate self by engaging inself-referential relationships with the other. Whether I gain or lose, therecan be a sense of I; if there is nothing to be gained or lost, I am groundless.If Hobbes’s despot were actually to succeed in obtaining everything in theuniverse, he would have to find some other preoccupation quickly, or he wouldbe in a woeful state: he would be unable to maintain his sense of himself. Ofcourse, as we have seen with nihilism, one can always turn that groundlessnessinto a ground; then one can maintain oneself in relation to it by feelingdespair. 

We believe that thisinsight is important to the social sciences if they are to explain the egoisticbehavior of individuals and groups. Even more important, however, is what themindful, open-ended approach to experience has to contribute to thetransformation of that egotism. 

### Compassion:Worlds without Ground 

If planetary thinkingrequires that we embody the realization of groundlessness in a scientificculture, planetary building requires the embodiment of concern for the otherwith whom we enact a world. The tradition of mindfulness/awareness offers apath by which this may actually be brought about. 

Themindfulness/awareness student first begins to see in a precise fashion what themind is doing, its restless, perpetual grasping, moment to moment. This enablesthe student to cut some of the automaticity of his habitual patterns, whichleads to further mindfulness, and he begins to realize that there is no self inany of his actual experience. This can be disturbing and offers the temptationto swing to the other extreme, producing moments of loss of heart. Thephilosophical flight into nihilism that we saw earlier in this chapter mirrorsa psychological process: the reflex to grasp is so strong and deep seated thatwe reify the absence of a solid foundation into a solid absence or abyss. 

As the student goes on,however, and his mind relaxes further into awareness, a sense of warmth andinclusiveness dawns. The street fighter mentality of watchful self-interest canbe let go somewhat to be replaced by interest in others. We are alreadyother-directed even at our most negative, and we already feel warmth towardsome people, such as family and friends. The conscious realization of the senseof relatedness and the development of a more impartial sense of warmth areencouraged in the mindfulness/awareness tradition by various contemplativepractices such as the generation of loving-kindness. It is said that the fullrealization of groundlessness (sunyata) cannot occur if there is no warmth. 

For this reason, in theMahayana tradition, which we have so far presented as being centrally concernedwith groundlessness as sunyata, there is an equally central and complementaryconcern with groundlessness as compassion.[11](#11_20) In fact, most of the traditionalMahayana presentations do not begin with groundlessness but rather with thecultivation of compassion for all sentient beings. Nagarjuna, for example,states in one of his works that the Mahayana teaching has “an essence ofemptiness and compassion.”[12](#12_18) This statement is sometimesparaphrased by saying that emptiness (sunyata) is full of compassion (karuna).[13](#13_19) 

Thus sunyata, the lossof a fixed reference point or ground in either self, other, or a relationshipbetween them, is said to be inseparable from compassion like the two sides of acoin or the two wings of a bird. Our natural impulse, in this view, is one ofcompassion, but it has been obscured by habits of ego-clinging like the sunobscured by a passing cloud. 

This is by no means the end of the path, however. For some traditions,there is a further step to be made in understanding beyond the sunyata ofcodependent origination—that is, the sunyata of naturalness. Up to now, we havebeen talking about the contents of realization in primarily negative terms: no-self, egolessness, no world, nonduality, emptiness,groundlessness. In actual fact, the majority of theworld’s Buddhists do not speak of their deepest concerns in negative terms;these negatives are preliminaries—necessary to remove habitual patterns ofgrasping, unsurpassably important and precious, but nonethelesspreliminaries—that are pointing toward the realization of a positivelyconceived state. The Western world—for example, Christianity—although pleasedto engage in dialogue with the negating aspects of Buddhism (perhaps as a wayof speaking to the nihilism in our own tradition), steadfastly (at times evenself-consciously) tends to ignore the Buddhist positive.[14](#14_19) 

To be sure, the Buddhistpositive is threatening. It is no ground whatsoever; it cannot be grasped asground, reference point, or nest for a sense of ego. It does not exist—nor doesit not exist.[15](#15_18) It cannot be an object of mind orof the conceptualizing process; it cannot be seen, heard, or thought—thus themany traditional images for it: the sight of a blind man, a flower blooming inthe sky. When the conceptual mind tries to grasp it, it finds nothing, and soit experiences it as emptiness. It can be known (and can only be known)directly. It is called Buddha nature, no mind, primordial mind, absolutebodhicitta, wisdom mind, warrior’s mind, all goodness, great perfection, that whichcannot be fabricated by mind, naturalness. It is not a hair’s breadth differentfrom the ordinary world; it is that very same ordinary, conditional,impermanent, painful, groundless world experienced (known) as theunconditional, supreme state. And the natural manifestation, the embodiment, ofthis state is compassion—unconditional, fearless, ruthless, spontaneouscompassion. “When the reasoning mind no longer clings and grasps, … one awakensinto the wisdom with which one was born, and compassionate energy ariseswithout pretense.”[16](#16_19) 

What do we mean byunconditional compassion? We need to backtrack and consider the development ofcompassion from the more mundane point of view of the student. The possibilityfor compassionate concern for others, which is present in all humans, isusually mixed with the sense of ego and so becomes confused with the need tosatisfy one’s own cravings for recognition and self-evaluation. The spontaneouscompassion that arises when one is not caught in the habitual patterns—when oneis not performing volitional actions out of karmic cause and effect—is not donewith a sense of need for feedback from its recipient. It is the anxiety aboutfeedback—the response of the other—that causes us tension and inhibition in ouraction. When action is done without the business-deal mentality, there can berelaxation. This is called supreme (or transcendental) generosity.[17](#17_17) 

If this seems abstract,the reader might try a brief exercise. We usually read books like this withsome heavy-handed sense of purpose. Imagine for a moment that you are readingthis solely in order to benefit others. Does that change the feeling tone ofthe task? 

When discussing wisdomfrom the point of view of compassion, the Sanskrit term often used is bodhicitta, which has been variously translated as“enlightened mind,” “the heart of the enlightened state of mind,” or simply“awakened heart.” Bodhicitta is said to have two aspects, one absolute and onerelative. Absolute bodhicitta is the term applied to whatever state isconsidered ultimate or fundamental in a given Buddhist tradition—the experienceof the groundlessness of sunyata or the (positively defined) sudden glimpse ofthe natural, awake state itself.[18](#18_17)Relative bodhicitta is that fundamental warmth toward the phenomenal world thatpractitioners report arises from absolute experience and that manifests itselfas concern for the welfare of others beyond merely naive compassion. As opposedto the order in which we have previously described these experiences, it issaid that the development of a sense of unproblematical warmth toward the worldleads to the experience of the flash of absolute bodhicitta. 

Buddhist practitioners obviously do not realize any of these things(even mindfulness) all at once. They report that they catch glimpses thatencourage them to make further efforts. One of the most important stepsconsists in developing compassion toward one’s own grasping fixation onego-self. The idea behind this attitude is that confronting one’s own graspingtendencies is a friendly act toward oneself. As this friendliness develops,one’s awareness and concern for those around one enlarges as well. It is atthis point that one can begin to envision a more open-ended and nonegocentriccompassion. 

Another characteristicof the spontaneous compassion that does not arise out of the volitional action ofhabitual patterns is that it follows no rules. It is not derived from anaxiomatic ethical system nor even from pragmatic moral injunctions. It iscompletely responsive to the needs of the particular situation. Nagarjunaconveys this attitude of responsiveness: 

Just as the grammarian makes one study grammar, 

A Buddha teaches according to the tolerance of his students; 

Some he urges to refrain from sins, others to do good, 

Some to rely on dualism, others on non-dualism; 

And to some he teaches the profound, 

The terrifying, the practice of enlightenment, 

Whose essence is emptiness that is compassion.[19](#19_17) 

Unrealizedpractitioners, of course, cannot dispense with rules and moral injunctions.There are many ethical rules in Buddhism whose aim is to put the body and mindinto a form that imitates as nearly as possible how genuine compassion mightbecome manifest in that situation (just as the meditative sitting posture issaid to be an imitation of enlightenment). 

With respect to itssituational specificity and its responsiveness, this view of nonegocentriccompassion might seem similar to what has been discussed in certain recentpsychoanalytic writings as “ethical know-how.”[20](#20_17) In the case of compassionateconcern as generated in the context of mindfulness/awareness, this know-howcould be said to be based in responsiveness to oneself and others as sentientbeings without ego-selves who suffer because they grasp after ego-selves. Andthis attitude of responsiveness is in turn rooted in an ongoing concern: Howcan groundlessness be revealed ethically as nonegocentric compassion? 

Compassionate action isalso called skillful means (upaya) in Buddhism.Skillful means are inseparable from wisdom. It is interesting to consider therelationship of skillful means to ordinary skills such as learning to drive acar or learning to play the violin. Is ethical action (compassionate action) inBuddhism to be considered a skill—perhaps analogous to the Heidegger/Dreyfusaccount of ethical action as a non-rule-based, developed skill?[21](#21_16) As we discussed at some lengthwith respect to meditation practice, in some ways skillful means in Buddhismcould be seen as similar to our notion of a skill: the student practices(“plants good seeds”)—that is, avoids harmful actions, performs beneficialones, meditates. Unlike an ordinary skill, however, in skillful means theultimate effect of these practices is to remove all egocentric habits so thatthe practitioner can realize the wisdom state, and compassionate action canarise directly and spontaneously out of wisdom. It is as if one were born alreadyknowing how to play the violin and had to practice with great exertion only toremove the habits that prevented one from displaying that virtuosity. 

It should by now be obvious that the ethics of compassion has nothingto do with satisfying some pleasure principle. Fom the standpoint ofmindfulness/awareness, it is fundamentally impossible to satisfy desires thatare born within the grasping mind. A sense of unconditional well-being arisesonly through letting go of the grasping mind. There is, however, no reason forascetism. Material and social goods are to be employed however the situationwarrants. (The middle way between the extremes of ascetism and indulgence isactually the historically earliest sense in which the term middleway was employed in Buddhism.) 

The results of the pathof mindful, open-ended learning are profoundly transformative. Instead of beingembodied (more accurately, reembodied moment after moment) out of struggle,habit, and sense of self, the goal is to become embodied out of compassion forthe world.[22](#22_17) The Tibetan tradition even talksabout the five aggregates being transformed into the five wisdoms. Notice thatthis sense of transformation does not mean going away from the world—gettingout of the five aggregates. The aggregates may be the constituents on which theinaccurate sense of self and world are based, but (more properly and) they are also the basis of wisdom. The means oftransforming the aggregates into wisdom is knowledge, realizing the aggregatesaccurately—empty of any egoistic ground whatsoever yet filled withunconditional goodness (Buddha nature, etc.), intrinsically just as they are inthemselves. 

How can such an attitudeof all encompassing, decentered, responsive, compassionate concern be fosteredand embodied in our culture? It obviously cannot be created merely throughnorms and rationalistic injunctions. It must be developed and embodied througha discipline that facilitates letting go of ego-centered habits and enablescompassion to become spontaneous and self-sustaining. The point is not thatthere is no need for normative rules in the relative world—clearly such rulesare a necessity in any society. It is that unless such rules are informed by thewisdom that enables them to be dissolved in the demands of responsivity to theparticularity and immediacy of lived situations, the rules will become sterile,scholastic hindrances to compassionate action rather than conduits for itsmanifestation. 

Perhaps less obvious buteven more strongly enjoined by the mindfulness/awareness tradition is thatmeditations and practices undertaken simply as self-improvement schemes willfoster only egohood. Because of the strength of egocentric habitualconditioning, there is a constant tendency, as practitioners in allcontemplative traditions are aware, to try to grasp, possess, and become proudof the slightest insight, glimpse of openness, or understanding. Unless suchtendencies become part of the path of letting go that leads to compassion, theninsights can actually do more harm than good. Buddhist teachers have oftenwritten that it is far better to remain as an ordinary person and believe inultimate foundations than to cling to some remembered experience of groundlessnesswithout manifesting compassion. 

Finally, talk alone willcertainly not suffice to engender spontaneous nonegocentric concern. Even morethan experiences of insight, words and concepts can be easily grasped at, takenas ground, and woven into a cloak of egohood. Teachers in all contemplativetraditions warn against fixated views and concepts taken as reality. Indeed,our promulgations of the concept of enactive cognitive science give us somepause. We would surely not want to trade the relative humility of objectivismfor the hubris of thinking that we construct our world. Better by far astraightforward cognitivist than a bloated and solipsistic enactivist. 

We simply cannotoverlook the need for some form of sustained, disciplined practice. This is notsomething that one can make up for oneself—any more than one can make up thehistory of Western science for oneself. Nothing will take its place; one cannotjust do one form of science rather than another andthink that one is gaining wisdom or becoming ethical. Individuals mustpersonally discover and admit their own sense of ego in order to go beyond it.Although this happens at the individual level, it has implications for scienceand for society. 

### InConclusion 

Let us restate why wethink ethics in the mindfulness/awareness tradition, and indeed, themindfulness/awareness tradition itself, are so important to the modern world.There is a profound discovery of groundlessness in our culture—in science, inthe humanities, in society, and in the uncertainties of people’s daily lives.This is generally seen as something negative—by everyone from the prophets ofour time to ordinary people struggling to find meaning in their lives. Takinggroundlessness as negative, as a loss, leads to a sense of alienation, despair,loss of heart, and nihilism. The cure that is generally espoused in our cultureis to find a new grounding (or return to older grounds). Themindfulness/awareness tradition points the way to a radically differentresolution. In Buddhism, we have a case study showing that when groundlessnessis embraced and followed through to its ultimate conclusions, the outcome is anunconditional sense of intrinsic goodness that manifests itself in the world asspontaneous compassion. We feel, therefore, that the solution for the sense ofnihilistic alienation in our culture is not to try to find a new ground; it isto find a disciplined and genuine means to pursue groundlessness, to go furtherinto groundlessness. Because of the preeminent place science occupies in ourculture, science must be involved in this pursuit. 

Althoughlate-twentieth-century science repeatedly undermines our conviction in anultimate ground, we nonetheless continue to seek one. We have laid down a pathin both cognitive science and human experience that would lead us away fromthis dilemma. We repeat that this is not a merely philosophical dilemma; it isalso ethical, religious, and political. Grasping can be expressed not onlyindividually as fixation on ego-self but also collectively as fixation onracial or tribal self-identity, as well as grasping for a ground as theterritory that separates one group of people from another or that one groupwould appropriate as its own. The idolatry of supposing not only that there isa ground but that one can appropriate it as one’s own acknowledges the otheronly in a purely negative, exclusionary way. The realization of groundlessnessas nonegocentric responsiveness, however, requires that we acknowledge theother with whom we dependently cooriginate. If our task in the years ahead, aswe believe, is to build and dwell in a planetary world, then we must learn touproot and release the grasping tendency, especially in its collectivemanifestations. 

When we widen ourhorizon to include transformative approaches to experience, especially thoseconcerned not with escape from the world or the discovery of some hidden, trueself but with releasing the everyday world from the clutches of the graspingmind and its desire for an absolute ground, we gain a sense of perspective onthe world that might be brought forth by learning to embody groundlessness ascompassion in a scientific culture. Since we have been most affected by theBuddhist tradition and its approach to experience through mindfulness/awareness,we were naturally led to rely on this tradition in relation to the task ofscientific and planetary building. Science is already deeply embedded in ourculture. Buddhism from all the world’s cultures is now taking root andbeginning to develop in the West. When these two planetary forces, science andBuddhism, come genuinely together, what might not happen? At the very least,the journey of Buddhism to the West provides some of the resources we need topursue consistently our own cultural and scientific premises to the point wherewe no longer need and desire foundations and so can take up the further tasksof building and dwelling in worlds without ground.

# Appendix A: Meditation Terminology 

Shamatha (Sanscrit) shine (Tibetan) Meditation forstilling and calming the mind. Traditionally, a concentration technique. It israrely practiced in its most pure, radical form. 

Vipassana (Pali) The meditation technique practiced today in the Theravadatradition of Buddhism. Its purpose is both to calm the mind and arouse insight.The general technique is for the mind to remain mindfully with its object,whatever that object may be. There are many specific techniques. 

Vispashyana (Sanscrit) Lhagthong (Tibetan) Insight. Theterm is used in at least two major senses: 

1.   Specific techniques used withinmeditation for examining the calmed mind to obtain insight into its nature. Forexample, one might be directed to investigate the point of the arising,dwelling, and vanishing of one’s thoughts. 

2.  The panoramic awareness inmeditation or daily life that enables the practitioner to see with a sense ofmature wisdom whatever is occurring. 

Shamatha/vispashyana (Sanscrit) A variety of techniques in which the functions of calmingthe mind and obtaining insight are combined. 

Shikantaza (Japanese) Just sitting. No technique.Somewhat equivalent to the second sense of vispashyana. 

The reader should notethat various modern schools of Buddhism refer to similar techniques bydifferent terms and different techniques by the same term, so one cannot tellfrom terminology alone what meditation is being practiced. 

A bibliography formeditation techniques is provided in appendix C. To practice meditation, oneshould obtain the guidance of a qualified teacher.

# Foreword to the Revised Edition 

Jon Kabat-Zinn 

In the annals recordingthe remarkable and improbable confluence of dharma, philosophy, and science inthis era, if such are ever written, The Embodied Mindwill be found to have played a seminal and historic role. 

I was elated and, inmany ways, awed when I first discovered it shortly after it was published bythe MIT Press in 1991. Not that I understood it all, or even most of it, sinceI am neither a cognitive scientist nor a philosopher by training. But Inonetheless was able to recognize its breadth and depth, the rigor, edginess,and bravery of its scholarly lines of argument, well beyond the thought linesof academic cognitive science, and sensed that its publication by the MIT Presswas a landmark and momentous signature of something new and profound emergingat the interface of science and dharma. 

What I did understand ofthe book at the time (which over the years I wound up reading, consulting, andhighlighting on multiple occasions), I found very much in alignment with my ownthinking from early on in my scientific career as a molecular biologistpondering questions such as what makes life life andhow consciousness arises from cells. It was also germane to my work, beginningin 1979, offering relatively intensive training in mindfulness meditation andmindful hatha yoga to medical patients with a wide range of diagnoses andchronic conditions and documenting what ensued in their lives and health fromsuch an engagement. In those early days, I found myself at times somewhattongue-in-cheek referring to this approach—that we later came to call MBSR, for“mindfulness-based stress reduction”—as “Buddhist meditation without theBuddhism,” since mindfulness had been explicitly and authoritativelycharacterized as “the heart of Buddhist meditation.”[1](#FN1)MBSR was meant from the start to be a clinical program orthogonal toconventional narratives of health and well-being, a laboratory for a moreexperiential and participatory medicine, a vehicle for self-education, healing,and transformation rather than a new “therapy.” It was conceived as a publichealth intervention and as a “skillful means” for demonstrating the liberativepotential of mindfulness practice in regard to conventional views of self andthe world and their attendant, often imprisoning narratives, which we allexperience to one degree or another. Without that underlying, if mostlyimplicit element, MBSR would not have been either “mindfulness-based” nor avehicle for dharma and, therefore, to my mind, of little value from theperspective of healing, transformation, or liberation.[2](#FN2)

I remember feelingconfirmed and uplifted by the centrality the authors accorded to “mindfulness”and “mindful awareness” in their wholly radical yet compelling, rigorous, andchallenging attempts to bring together the fields of cognitive science,phenomenology, and dharma to examine the larger connections between mind, body,and experience. This feeling was amplified by the fact that the analysis andarguments were coming from not one but three authors, who seemed to be speakingwith one voice from an unusually deep collaboration, and who were obviouslyalso speaking from their own direct, “first-person”[3](#FN3)experience of mindfulness meditation practice, in addition to being seriousscientist-researchers, philosophers, and scholars with grounding in the worldsof cognitive science and phenomenology, as well as in the contemplative andphilosophical traditions within Buddhism. So it felt that they were themselvesembodying in their collaboration what they were putting forth, a new way of, intheir words, “laying down a path in walking.” This impression is onlystrengthened now by the “correctives” the authors haveadded in their introductions to this edition to clarify a deeper understandingof mindfulness grounded in lived experience and, in particular, inrelationality itself and in what they term “enaction.” These correctives arereally evolving refinements indicative of ongoing learning and growing, and arebased on continuing investigation, reflection, inquiry, dialogue amongcolleagues, and actual embodied and enacted cultivation/practice ofmindfulness. They are themselves “vital signs” of health, if you will,indicators of the vitality of the evolutionary arc of thinking and praxis atthe cutting edge where cognitive science and the meditative disciplinesconverge and radically challenge each other’s models and understanding. Stasisat this interface would be tantamount to attachment to and self-identificationwith unexamined assumptions and particular views, habits of mind that arethemselves root causes of so much ignorance and suffering according to thewisdom traditions that articulated so precisely and rigorously many of thelines of inquiry pursued by the authors in the original text. So suchcorrectives are very welcome signs of a natural generativity, learning, andhumility at play here—just what one hopes for in science, in meditativepractice, and in life. 

At the time of the firstedition and for many years afterwards, the MIT Press was headed up by the lateFrank Urbanowski, a practitioner and student of Buddhist meditation himself,and a friend. Frank knew exactly what he was doing by publishing The Embodied Mind. It became the first and among the mostprofound and transformative of a whole family of books on cognitive science andthe mind that he acquired. It was a cardinal example of what Frank termed“focused disciplinary specialization,” a strategy that continues to be asignature feature of the MIT Press’s publishing approach to this day and thatis responsible in many ways for its ongoing success. The reissuing of The Embodied Mind now, in this new edition, after almosttwenty-five years, with new introductions by the surviving authors and with theoriginal text unchanged, is evidence that the book’s analyses, arguments, andimpact have only grown in importance and relevance over the interveningdecades. Indeed, the world has become so much more receptive to mindfulnessthat this book’s republication heralds a new era in our deep collectiveinvestigation, appreciation, and possible understanding of some up-to-nowfairly intractable domains: the nature of thought and emotion, the nature ofwhat we call “mind” and its non-separation from “body,” and the nature of whatwe call “self” and its non-separation from “others” and from the surroundingembracing world out of which life and mind emerge.[4](#FN4)And let’s include as well the nature of sentience and of experience itself,what the authors now refer to as “first-person experience,” so much less biasedand invalidating a term than its forerunner, “subjective experience.” Theirexpounding on Merleau-Ponty’s notion of “the lived body” alone is a major andongoing contribution to this inquiry.[5](#FN5) 

I started graduateschool at MIT in molecular biology in 1964, wanting naively and romantically toinvestigate the fundamental nature of life and how it relates to self and tomind. I worked on bacteria, bacteriophage, and colicins, hoping that theexperience would serve as a good foundation (it did) for ultimatelyinvestigating the human mind from both the outside (the “third-personperspective”) and the inside (the “first-person perspective”). Bacteria, ofcourse, are single-celled organisms, with an inside that is “alive” and a cellmembrane keeping the inside intact, the outside out, and facilitating adynamical exchange of energy and matter that keeps the inside conditions justright for life to perpetuate itself. Bacteriophage (viruses that infectbacteria with their DNA or RNA) and colicins (proteins that kill certainbacterial cells from the outside, and that are encoded by plasmids within theDNA of the source bacterium) are not alive, but they both use the life of thecell to replicate more of themselves, using different strategies. Fundamentalmolecular and dynamical distinctions between inside and outside, life andnon-life, lie at the heart of one of Francisco Varela’s many interests andcontributions, namely the phenomenon of autopoiesisthat, together with Humberto Maturana, he posited as the original emergence ofrudimentary “cognition” in life. Evan Thompson wrote a whole book on thesubject, tellingly entitled Mind in Life.[6](#FN6)But the subject implicitly and explicitly anchors a great deal of The Embodied Mind and its revolutionary orientation towardembodiment and “knowing”—what the authors put forth, following the terminologyof the Buddha, as a middle way. 

One might say that we are moving toward an intimate yet universal,non-reductionist, non-dual understanding of the phenomenal world and our placein it. This book was and is a major stepping-stone along that trajectory. Suchan understanding cannot ignore the unique particulars of diverse cultures,viewpoints, meditative traditions, and their ethical underpinnings andaspirations, to say nothing of the unexplained but reliably documentedmysteries that Eleanor Rosch points to in her introduction. As she says, the book“is about something real” (X): in essence, “anothermode of knowing not based on an observer and observed” (X).What could be more real, more challenging, and more potentially liberating,transformative, and healing than that? She also cogently points out a range ofcritical issues that need precise clarification and understanding when it comesto determining what people are actually practicing or being taught to practice(very different things in all likelihood) within various curricula claiming tobe “mindfulness-based,” as well as in programs based on other consciousnessdisciplines. The complexities abound. This is both extremely healthy and, atthe same time, a conundrum for scientific investigation, demanding new levelsof precision both in the descriptions of what is being taught and in firstperson accounts of what is being attempted and experienced, moment by moment.[7](#FN7)Francisco Varela would have had a field day with the vast opportunitiespresented to us in this unique era of the confluence of cognitive science,phenomenology, and dharma that he contributed hugely to bringing about. But hisvision, his insights, and his voice are enduring and timeless, intimatelypermeating this volume and residing in the hearts and perspectives of hiscoauthors, as well as in his friends and former students and colleagues aroundthe world. 

May this new editiontouch the minds and hearts and imagination of many, far and wide, in manydifferent disciplines, and contribute to the “profound transformation of humanawareness” (X) that was its original aspiration andremains so, appropriately amplified, to this day. That profound transformationand the accompanying learning to inhabit the spaciousness and boundlessness ofawareness itself as the core of our embodied being, and then taking wise actionfor the benefit of others and ourselves from that vantage point when calledfor, is more sorely needed now on this planet than ever before.

# Introduction to the Revised Edition 

Evan Thompson 

Almost thirty years ago,in the summer of 1986 in Paris, Francisco Varela and I began writing what wouldeventually become this book. I was a first-year Ph.D. student in philosophy atthe University of Toronto and Varela had just moved to the Ecole Polytechniqueand the Institut des Neurosciences. We had met about ten years earlier in thesummer of 1977 when he came to a conference at the Lindisfarne Association, aneducational institute and contemplative community founded by my father, WilliamIrwin Thompson. My father and Gregory Bateson, who was Lindisfarne’s scholar inresidence that summer, led the conference, called “Mind and Nature.”[1](#FN1_1) Varela in turn was a Lindisfarne scholar inresidence in 1978. Living together at Lindisfarne in Southampton, New York, andManhattan, he became a member of our family—a combination of uncle and olderbrother to me, as well as my intellectual mentor. That relationship was thecontext in which we worked together on The Embodied Mindin Paris from 1986 to 1989. 

Varela had moved toParis from Chile by way of the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt (where he hadcollaborated with neuroscientist Wolf Singer for a year)[2](#FN2_1)in order to set up his laboratory investigating the neurophysiology of vision.I had graduated from Amherst College, where I majored in Asian Studies andstudied Buddhist philosophy. I planned to write my philosophy dissertation incognitive science and the philosophy of mind. My first published paper—arevision of my undergraduate thesis on Martin Heidegger and the Japanesephilosopher Nishitani Keiji—had just been published in the journal Philosophy East and West.[3](#FN3_1)Varela had read the paper (I still have the typewritten letter he sent me fromthe Max Planck Institute with his comments on an early draft) and he encouragedme to apply to a German philosophy foundation for research support. A grantfrom the foundation—the Stiftung Zur Förderung der Philosophie—supported mystay in Paris in the summer of 1986. That summer Varela also suggested that Iwrite my dissertation on theories of perception, using color vision, andspecifically the investigation of color vision in different animal species, asmy focus. Comparative color vision was the main focus of Varela’s experimentalwork at the time, so I learned color vision science and wrote my dissertationin his lab while we worked together on this book.[4](#FN4_1)

Eleanor Rosch joined usin 1989. I had moved to Berkeley, where I was a visiting postdoctoral scholarin philosophy, and where Rosch was a professor of psychology. Varela and Roschhad also been friends for many years. The three of us finished the book in1989–1990. 

By the end of our firstsummer working together in 1989, Varela and I had a first draft of the corechapters and a working title—Worlds Without Ground,which became the title of part V—suggested by my father. (We changed the titleto The Embodied Mind in 1990.) The title came fromone of our guiding ideas, the philosophical idea of groundlessness.In Buddhist philosophy, groundlessness means that phenomena lack any inherentand independent being; they are said to be “empty” of “own being.” In Westernphilosophy, groundlessness means that knowledge and meaning lack any absolutefoundation. Biology and cognitive science were arriving at the same idea—thathuman cognition is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by aseparate mind or self, but instead the bringing forth or enacting of adependent world of relevance in and through embodied action. Cognition as theenaction of a world means that cognition has no ground or foundation beyond itsown history, which amounts to a kind of “groundlessground.” At the same time, the discovery of groundlessness places us in anexistential quandary because we habitually experience things as if they didhave an absolute ground, either in what we take to be the outside world or inwhat we take to be our self. Is this discrepancy between scientific knowledgeand lived experience inevitable and insurmountable? Or are cognitive scienceand human experience somehow reconcilable? Is it possible for cognitive scienceand human experience to reshape each other in a transformative way beyond ourscientific and habitual, experiential reifications of a separate self and anindependent world? These questions were the ones that motivated and inspired uswhen we set out to write this book. 

Many things have changedin the intervening years, in ways that make this book more immediatelyaccessible than when it was first published. The embodied cognition approach isnow central to cognitive science.[5](#FN5_1) Whereas thedominant model of the brain in early cognitive science was that of astimulus-driven, sequential processing computer, it is now widely recognizedthat brain activity is largely self-organizing, nonlinear, rhythmic, parallel,and distributed.[6](#FN6_1) The idea that there is a deepcontinuity in the principles of self-organization from the simplest livingthings to more complex cognitive beings—an idea central to Varela’s earlierwork with neurobiologist Humberto Maturana[7](#FN7_1)—is now amainstay of theoretical biology and is receiving increasing attention inneuroscience.[8](#FN8) Subjective experience andconsciousness, once taboo subjects for cognitive science, are now importantresearch topics, especially in cognitive neuroscience.[9](#FN9)Phenomenology now plays an active role in the philosophy of mind andexperimental cognitive science.[10](#FN10) Meditation andmindfulness practices are increasingly used in clinical contexts and are agrowing subject of investigation in behavioral psychology and cognitiveneuroscience.[11](#FN11) And Buddhist philosophy isincreasingly recognized as an important interlocutor in contemporaryphilosophy.[12](#FN12) 

Nevertheless, themotivating questions of this book have only become more pointed. Consider thefrequent pronouncements made in the name of neuroscience that the self isnothing but an illusion created by the brain’s workings, that the world we experienceis really a neural simulation, or that consciousness is nothing but a brainprocess. Our personal experience, however, presents things differently. We feelas if there is a real self that is the subject of our consciousness and that isin direct contact with an independent, real world. Although we may dispute thephilosophical assumptions on which such neuroscientific pronouncements rest,such disputation by itself does nothing to change our lived experience. Hencethe quandary: either accept what science seems to be telling us and deny ourexperience—thereby forgetting that lived experience is the source of science,and that science can never ultimately step outside it—or hold fast to ourexperience and deny science—thereby forgetting that experience itselfconstantly seeks to enlarge its own horizons through scientific investigation.Our present culture is still caught up in the constant oscillation betweenthese two tendencies. 

As this book describes,nihilism is the viewpoint that inevitably arises in this predicament. I use theterm nihilism in Nietzsche’s sense, which NishitaniKeiji elaborated in relation to modern science and Buddhism in his monumentalwork Religion and Nothingness (see chapter 11).[13](#FN13)The nihilist sees through the illusion of a real, independent self that wouldgrasp a real, independent world, but he cannot find another way to be or livewithout the illusion. More generally, the nihilist sees that there is noabsolute ground of meaning—for example, that meaning cannot be grounded on atranscendent God or a real, inner self—but he cannot find another way to be orlive without the desire for such a ground. Eventually the nihilist mistakenly(and incoherently) concludes that even meaning is an illusion and thateverything is really meaningless. 

Our overriding aim inwriting this book was to seek a way out of this impasse by charting a path forthe transformation of both everyday human experience and the philosophy andpractice of cognitive science. 

Our approach was to create a “circulation” between cognitive scienceand human experience. Cognitive science tells us that the processes that bringabout our experience of the world, including our sense of self, are dynamical,distributed in time and space, and extend across the complex couplings of thebrain, the rest of the body, and the environment. Although it may seem as ifthere is a single, abiding self that functions as the controller of the mind,cognitive science indicates that what we call “the mind” is a collection ofconstantly changing, emergent processes that arise within a complex systemcomprising the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical and socialenvironment, and in which we find no single, abiding, and controlling self. Howare we to make sense of these discoveries in relation to our personalexperience? 

However we may choose toanswer this question, we cannot begin to address it without relying on somekind of phenomenology, that is, on some kind of descriptive account of ourexperience in the everyday world. But where are we to find this phenomenology?One place to look is the Western philosophical tradition of phenomenology,inaugurated by Edmund Husserl and carried forward by Martin Heidegger andMaurice Merleau-Ponty. Although we relied on this tradition, especially itsinsights into groundlessness, we also argued that it had gotten bogged down inabstract, theoretical reflection and had lost touch with its originalinspiration to examine lived experience in a rigorous way. (I no longer acceptthis view of Western phenomenology, as I discuss below.) For this reason, weturned to Buddhist philosophy and psychology, which, we believed, were based onscrupulously attending to experience through mindfulness meditation (but seebelow). We focused on two, interrelated Buddhist ideas. One idea was that of not-self or no-self—that thesense of an abiding, controlling self is a construct arising from certaindeep-seated cognitive and emotional tendencies to impute permanence andsingleness to what is impermanent and multiple. The other idea was that of dependent origination—that all phenomena arise dependent oncauses and conditions, and therefore all phenomena lack substantial being. Weargued that these ideas could help to make sense of our lived experience in theeveryday world in relation to the findings of cognitive science, while alsocorrecting the tendency within cognitive science to dismiss our experienceoutright as an epiphenomenal illusion. 

In this way, wejuxtaposed three traditions—cognitive science, Western phenomenology, andBuddhism—and we used Buddhist philosophy and psychology to enrich phenomenologyin ways that could also advance cognitive science. To use a term of art fromhermeneutical philosophy, our aim was to “fuse the horizons” of cognitivescience, phenomenology, and Buddhism in a new and larger understanding.[14](#FN14)On the one hand, we aimed to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science toinclude lived, human experience and the possibilities for transformationinherent in human experience—specifically, the possibility of our not beingheld hostage to the reification of an abiding self, but without our fallinginto the nihilistic denial of the everyday self, a nihilism to which cognitivescience remains especially prone. On the other hand, we aimed to enlarge thehorizon of human experience to include the insights into cognition, the body,and the self from cognitive science. Buddhist philosophy and thephenomenological importance of mindfulness meditation, together with the newlyemerging embodied cognition approach in cognitive science, were the newcritical resources we brought to this effort. In summary, our aim was to forgea mutually enlightening and transformative relationship between cognitivescience and human experience via a pragmatic and open-ended phenomenology ofembodiment. 

Three decades later, Isee this vision and effort to create a new kind of relationship betweencognitive science and human experience as the book’s original and lastingcontribution. It makes the book “about something real,” to borrow the openingwords of Eleanor Rosch’s introduction, while also making the book “not fiteasily into any of the usual academic disciplines” (X).It is also responsible, I believe, for the book’s lasting influence in thestudy of embodied cognition—not just in cognitive science, but also in the artsand the humanities, as well as in somatics and the bodywork disciplines. 

At the same time, when Ireread the book now I cannot help but see it as limited by severalshortcomings, ones that have become increasingly apparent to me over the yearsand that we need to leave behind in order to advancethe vision and project of this book. Specifically, I no longer accept three ofthe rhetorical and argumentative strategies on which we relied. 

The first strategy isour portrayal of Western phenomenology, in the tradition of Husserl, Heidegger,and Merleau-Ponty, as a failed or broken down philosophical project (seechapter 2). On the contrary, Western phenomenology remains a vital and importantmovement of continuing relevance to philosophy and cognitive science, as wellas to practical disciplines of human transformation. My book Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology,and the Sciences of Mind argues this point at length and includes anappendix specifically devoted to correcting and explaining the reasons for ourmischaracterization of Husserl in The Embodied Mind.[15](#FN15)Other philosophers, notably Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi, have shown theimportance of phenomenology for cognitive science.[16](#FN16)Many important phenomenological works have appeared in the last two decades,making phenomenology a rich and active area of contemporary thought.[17](#FN17)These works include not just phenomenological philosophy, but alsophenomenology as a way of doing qualitative research in tandem with cognitivescience.[18](#FN18) Varela, in the last years of hislife before he died in 2001, contributed to this revitalization ofphenomenology, specifically in his contributions to the “naturalizingphenomenology” movement, his helping to found the new journal Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, and especially inhis scientific research program of “neurophenomenology,” which uses Westernphenomenology as well as mindfulness practices in the investigation of thelarge-scale brain dynamics related to conscious experience.[19](#FN19)Neurophenomenology provides the framework for my most recent book, Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience,Meditation, and Philosophy, which revisits many of the ideas and topicsof The Embodied Mind.[20](#FN20) 

The second strategy isour depiction of Buddhist philosophy, specifically the Indian BuddhistAbhidharma school and the writings of the Madhyamaka (middle way) philosopherNāgārjuna, as based on meditation or as deriving from meditative experience. Inow see this idea as being simplistic and inaccurate. As Buddhist scholars havediscussed, the formation and evolution of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist philosophy wereshaped by many factors, such as doctrinal constraints, scholasticism, and the pressingneed to respond to non-Buddhist philosophers.[21](#FN21) For thesereasons (among others), we cannot suppose that Indo-Tibetan philosophical ideaswere derived directly from meditation. Indeed, it is equally possible thattheoretical ideas, such as the momentariness of mental processes (see chapters4–6), shaped certain kinds of meditative experience. The extent to whichBuddhist philosophical ideas either shaped or were shaped by meditativeexperience remains an open and interesting question in the field of Buddhiststudies. 

In any case, classicalIndian Buddhist philosophy was certainly not based on the kind of “Buddhistmodernist” style of meditation that we call “mindfulness/awareness.” “Buddhistmodernism” is a contemporary, transnational form of Buddhism that cuts acrossAsian and Western cultural and geographical contexts.[22](#FN22)One of its central elements is a style of mindfulness meditation practice thatderives largely from the modern Theravada Buddhist meditation revival thatoccurred in Burma, Thailand, and Sri Lanka during the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies.[23](#FN23) The mindfulness meditationmethods promoted by this movement influenced modern Asian Buddhist reformersand teachers, especially in the West, as well as Western teachers who studiedin Asia and returned to teach in the West. Virtually all of the contemporarymeditation instruction texts we list in appendix C and on which we relied indescribing mindfulness meditation can be described as Buddhist modernist works.My point in calling attention to this fact is not at all to suggest thatBuddhist modernism is somehow a less “authentic” form of Buddhism; on thecontrary, such appeals to “authenticity” are unsustainable, for Buddhism is andalways has been a constantly evolving tradition. Rather, it is to alert thereader to the fact that our assumption that Buddhist philosophy derives frommeditation is a typically Buddhist modernist claim and one that does not dojustice to the complex historical and interpretative issues that arise in trying to relate mindfulness meditationpractices (especially in their Buddhist modernist form) to the Abhidharma andMadhyamaka philosophies. 

As a philosopher, I alsofeel duty bound to declare that Buddhist philosophy is every bit as abstract,theoretical, and technical as Western philosophy, so the idea that Buddhistphilosophy is somehow closer to direct experience and thereby more immediatelyphenomenological—as we state at certain points in the text—is misguided.Moreover, being able to be abstract, theoretical, and technical is a strengthof Indian and Tibetan Buddhist philosophy, and also of the Indian and Tibetanphilosophical traditions overall, not a weakness.[24](#FN24)

The third strategy isour tendency sometimes to depict “mindful awareness” or “mindfulness” as aspecial kind of inner observation of a mental stream whose phenomenal characteris supposed to be somehow independent of such observation. This tendency isevident when we argue that mindful awareness reveals consciousness to really bediscontinuous and gappy (rather than just appearing to be so in certaincontexts and under certain conditions) (see chapter 4). Hubert Dreyfus, in hisreview of The Embodied Mind, rightly objected to thisconception of phenomenology as inward observation.[25](#FN25)As he pointed out, such an effort of inward observation alters experience, sono valid claim can be made on the basis of such observation about howexperience is apart from such observation. Moreover, reading the results ofsuch inward observation back into world-immersed, embodied experience wouldinevitably distort such experience. Besides wishing to acknowledge Dreyfus’scriticism,[26](#FN26) I mention it here because theBuddhism–cognitive science encounter continues to be influenced by the idea ofBuddhist mindfulness practice as offering a special kind of introspection thatcan serve the purposes of the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. In myview, however, although mindfulness practices can facilitate a unique kind ofacute awareness of what phenomenologists such as Merleau-Ponty call the“phenomenal field” of lived experience,[27](#FN27) this kind ofawareness is not inward observation in any introspectionist sense of“inward”—for example, it is not the inward perception of basic mental elements,whether these be sensations, after the fashion of Western introspectionistpsychology, or momentary and elementary mental events, after the fashion ofAbhidharma. 

TheEmbodied Mind also contains another, betterconception of mindfulness meditation. According to this conception, mindfulnesspractices should be understood as skillful ways of enacting certain kinds ofembodied states and behaviors in the world, not as inner observation of anobserver-independent mental stream. This conception connects to the central,original idea of the book, namely, the view of cognition that we call enaction or the enactive approach(mentioned at the outset of this introduction). 

In formulating theenactive approach, we drew on multiple sources: the theory of living organismsas self-producing or “autopoietic” systems that bring forth their own cognitivedomains; newly emerging work on embodied cognition (how sensorimotorinteractions with the world shape cognition); Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology ofthe lived body; and the Buddhist philosophical idea of dependent origination,and specifically that cognition and the experienced world co-arise in mutualdependence. The basic idea of the enactive approach is that the living body isa self-producing and self-maintaining system that enacts or brings forthrelevance, and that cognitive processes belong to the relational domain of theliving body coupled to its environment.[28](#FN28) Oneimplication of this idea is that cognition requires the exercising ofcapacities for skillful action and that even abstract cognitive processes aregrounded on the body’s sensorimotor systems, including the brain systems that,as we would say today, emulate sensorimotor processes in an “offline” way.Today, this idea of cognition as based on modal sensorimotor processes iscentral to the approach called “grounded cognition,” where “grounded” meansbased on body states, situated action, and modal perception-action systems.[29](#FN29)

From the enactiveperspective, mindfulness practices should be viewed as forms of skillful know-how for enacting certain situated mind–body statesand behaviors, not as a form of inner observation of a private mental realm.Notice that this contrast—between understanding mindfulness meditation as akind of enactive cognition versus as a kind of inner mental observation—is aconceptual and phenomenological one. Notice also that each conception hasimplications for cognitive science. On the one hand, thinking of mindfulnessmeditation as inner observation of a private mental realm feeds the internalisttendency in cognitive neuroscience to model mindfulness as a kind of mentalactivity instantiated in neural networks inside the head and visible throughbrain imaging tools such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI). This approach runs the risk of confusing thebiological conditions for mindfulness with mindfulness itself, which, asclassically described, consists of the integrated exercise of a whole host ofcognitive and bodily skills in situated and ethically directed action.[30](#FN30)On the other hand, thinking of meditation as the enactment of situatedmind–body states and behaviors requires us to distinguish clearly between thecausally enabling conditions for mindfulness, which include neural systems butare not limited to them, and the cognitive processes that constitutemindfulness as a meaningful form of human experience and that cannot be fullyunderstood unless described phenomenologically. This is one way in whichthinking through the enactive approach returns us to the phenomenology of livedexperience as a necessary complement to scientific investigation. 

Since the publication ofthis book, the enactive approach has usually been understood as a particularversion of the embodied cognition paradigm in cognitive science.[31](#FN31)According to this paradigm, the body plays a constitutive role in cognition,that is, cognition depends directly on the body as a functional whole and notjust the brain. The enactive approach adds a number of specific ideas about thebody and cognition; many researchers have extensively developed these ideas inthe past two decades.[32](#FN32) First, what is meant by “body,”for the enactive approach, is not the body as a functional system defined interms of inputs and outputs—as it is for functionalist cognitive science—butrather the body as an adaptively autonomous and sense-making system. Anadaptively autonomous system is one that generates and maintains itself throughconstant structural and functional change (like a living cell), and in so doingbrings forth or enacts relevance. In being a self-individuating system, it isalso a sense-making one, and in being a sense-making system, it is also aself-individuating one. Cognition and world are interdependently originated viathe living body. Second, the nervous system is accordingly understood as anadaptively autonomous dynamical system: it actively generates and maintains itsown coherent and meaningful patterns of activity, according to its operation asa self-organizing network of interacting neurons. The nervous system does notprocess preexistent information in the traditional computationalist sense; itcreates information in concert with the rest of the body and the environment.Third, cognition as sense-making is the exercise of skillful know-how insituated and embodied action. Cognitive structures and processes emerge fromand constitutively depend on recurrent sensorimotor patterns of perception andaction. At the same time, the sensorimotor coupling between the organism and itsenvironment does not determine the ongoing, self-organizing brain activity; itmodulates it while that brain activity in turn informs the sensorimotorcoupling. Fourth, a cognitive being’s world is not a pre-specified, externalrealm, represented internally by its brain, but is rather a relational domainenacted or brought forth by that being in and through its mode of coupling withthe environment. Finally, experience is not an epiphenomenal side issue but iscentral to any understanding of the mind, and accordingly needs to beinvestigated in a careful phenomenological manner. Hence, in the enactiveapproach, cognitive scientific and phenomenological investigations of humanexperience are pursued in a complementary and mutually informing way. 

Less noticed, however,in the literature on embodied cognition, is that the enactive approach alsoimplies a certain conception of science. This conception derives fromreflexively applying the enactive ideas about cognition to science itself. Oncewe perform this reflexive operation we can no longer hold on to the traditionalrealist conception of science as revealing the way things are in themselvesapart from our interactions with them. Yet neither is it the case that scienceis simply a creation or projection of our own minds. Rather, science is ahighly refined distillation of our embodied sense-making.As Husserl originally argued in his last work, The Crisis ofEuropean Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, the implicitdeparture point and always-present background condition for science is ourconcrete, sensuous experience of the life-world.[33](#FN33)In creating classical science, we set aside features of this kind of experiencethat vary individually and cannot be made the object of a stable consensus.Using logic and mathematics, we create an abstract and formal representation ofcertain invariant and structural features of what we experience underrigorously controlled conditions that we impose, and this formal model becomesan object of consensus and the basis for an objective description. Scientificmodels, according to this account, are formalized representations of the worldas disclosed to our embodied cognition. Put another way, scientificrepresentations map structural and dynamical features of how the world isdisclosed to us at various spatiotemporal scales and of how we are able to acton or intervene in processes at these scales. In this way, scientific modelsare distillations of our embodied experience as observers, modelers, andinterveners. In short, scientific knowledge is not the exhibition of the natureof reality as it is in itself; it is an expression of the relation between ourembodied cognition and the world that it purports to know.[34](#FN34)

It is important to keepthis enactive conception of science in mind when we think about the dialoguebetween cognitive science and phenomenology. Not keeping it in mind meansfalling back into an objectivist conception of science, for which embodied experiencebecomes simply another object of empirical investigation. But lived experienceis inevitably distorted when we treat it this way, that is, as being completelycomprehensible through scientific procedures of objectification. Embodiedexperience is precisely not objectifiable in this way, for it is that whichmakes possible any of our cognitive encounters with any object (as we depict infigures 1.2–1.5). Remembering this non-objectifiable dimension of embodiedexperience—that embodied experience is a necessary condition of possibility foranything showing up as an object of scientific investigation—prevents therelationship between phenomenology and science from becoming lopsided in favorof science. Science departs from and in the end must answer to embodiedexperience and does not provide understanding on its own. This is especiallythe case when the subject matter of scientific investigation is the human mind.

In presenting anenactive conception of science in this book, we used ideas from Madhyamaka philosophy(see chapters 10 and 11). In this way, Buddhist philosophy played a direct rolein shaping the enactive approach. This point is especially important toremember when we think about the dialogue between Buddhism and cognitivescience. This dialogue is not equivalent to the scientific investigation ofmindfulness meditation—a research trend that is becoming increasinglywidespread today but was virtually nonexistent when we wrote this book.Although this research is worthwhile, it is neither the same as nor sufficientfor the kind of circulation between science and Buddhism that we tried tofoster in this book. Buddhist philosophy and meditative practice, especially asinformed by the Madhyamaka tradition, aim to undermine the objectifying and reifyingtendencies of the mind. These tendencies, however, can easily be reinforcedwhen one turns meditative experience into a scientific object—for example, byremoving individual practitioners from their social context, placing them in anfMRI scanner, and projecting their meditative practice onto neural activationpatterns. The Madhyamaka-informed, enactive conception of science serves toremind us that such research provides, at best, a heuristic handle on certainlimited aspects of mindfulness meditation practices as they have beenrecontextualized in the cognitive neuroscience laboratory, not an exhibition ofsome underlying and objective “biological reality” of meditation, let alone adetermination of the value of meditative practice as a way of life. Moreover,without Madhyamaka philosophy and the reflexive application of the enactiveapproach to science itself, we will miss the radical transformativepossibilities of the science–Buddhism circulation, and specifically theprospect of a different way of being in the world and doing science beyond ourhabitual cognitive reifications. In other words, we will miss the guidingvision of this book. 

This vision—to undo orat least reduce our self-centered ways of being, especially as they shape and are shaped by science and technology—is decidedlynormative and so makes this book different from many other scientific andphilosophical works on embodied cognition. Many readers may take this vision tobe a specifically Buddhist one. When I reread the book today, I cannot denythat much of its content and tone justifies such a reading. Nevertheless,promoting a “Buddhist cognitive science” or writing a work of Buddhistmodernism has never been my intention. Indeed, the parts of the book that Ilike the least are the ones where we veer into that mode of discourse. Rather,my intention has always been to foster a new kind of wisdom, one rooted in amature cognitive science that is deeply informed by experiential practices ofethical human transformation. Buddhism is an important source for this effort,but my aim is not to advocate for this tradition per se but rather to draw fromits rich philosophy and practice in order to create a contemplative andcross-cultural cognitive science that does justice to our full developmentalcapacities for awakening. My hope is that this vision can inspire a newgeneration of readers who take up this book.

# Introduction to the Revised Edition 

Eleanor Rosch 

This book is aboutsomething real. For that reason it does not fit easily into any of the usualacademic disciplines. It is not science, it is not philosophy, it is notphenomenology, and it is certainly not Buddhism, although it touches on all ofthese. Nevertheless, for twenty-plus years the book has served as a provocateur for academic and nonacademic readers alike.During that time, the issues with which it deals, such as relations between thesciences of mind and human personal experience (yourpersonal experience), have become more prominent and culturally visible, but byno means resolved. 

A bit of history: Iconfess that working on The Embodied Mind with thelate Francisco Varela sometimes felt to me like entering an Indonesianshadow-puppet play. A central part of these plays is a sequence in which theprotagonists cross into “the forest,” a charmed space where it becomes possiblefor beings from different orders of reality—humans, gods, clowns, heroes,demons—to meet and interact, thereby propelling the drama on its way. In asomewhat analogous fashion, the aim of The Embodied Mindwas to create an open space in which normally separated aspects of humanknowledge represented by different modes of discourse and different academicdisciplines could meet, speak, and perhaps cross-fertilize one another. We wereparticularly concerned with the gulf between the human mind as studied byscience and the mind as personally experienced—now often spoken of as thedisconnect between first person and third person knowledge. To approach thisdisconnect we juxtaposed three disciplines usually considered worlds apart: thenew interdisciplinary science of the mind called cognitive science, thephenomenological tradition in philosophy, and some aspects of the Easternreligion of Buddhism. Through the interplay of these three voices we emergedwith the outline of a new kind of cognitive science called enactionthat we argued would provide the ground for a science both embodied andexperientially relevant. 

Now, twenty-five yearslater, much has changed in the cultural and intellectual environment in whichordinary people live and in which research on body and mind is performed,changes that make The Embodied Mind even morerelevant and probably more accessible than when first published: 

1)  This is the era ofbody, particularly of the brain. New techniques such as functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) and an enhanced electroencephalogram (EEG) have madeit possible to observe changes in blood flow and electrical activity in thebrain in real time, thus providing a window into the relation between thoughts,emotions, and brain activity. Increasingly the prevailing assumption inpsychology, cognitive science, and many other fields is that the mind (andhence experience) is just the brain and that the gold standard for studyinganything human is to observe changes in the brain. Note our new vocabulary: notonly is there neuroscience but also neuro-economics, neuro-ethics … evenneuro-theology. But body is not necessarily the sameas embodied; what is that body that is underscrutiny? 

2)  This is also the eraof personal technology. Hence it is not surprising that the brain (and thus themind with its experiences) is increasingly assumed to work like a computer,that is, for all its subtlety to be a machine that should be studiedaccordingly. A personal side of this technological change may be the overridingof much self-awareness. Where once there were spaces in the day between eventsto digest information, reflect on occurrences, notice one’s reactions, and bewith one’s thoughts and emotions, now there is only time to whip out the cellphone. 

These first two trends have to do with the objectification of scienceand the externalization of our lives; they provide the background from whichthe quest of this book and our concept of enaction stand out as contrast. Thenext three, more local in scope but potentially of great generative importance,are efforts toward reclaiming the mind. 

3)  Interest inphenomenology is growing, particularly in Europe and Latin America. In strictusage, phenomenology refers to work stemming from the school of philosophyoriginated by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, butit is now also applied to research that looks into experience through a varietyof other methods. While phenomenology is the province of my coauthor EvanThompson, I wish to make just one point about it here. We began The Embodied Mind with a single phenomenological insightthat can turn objectivist science (and one’s world view) on its head if oneallows it to. Everything perceived, believed, theorized, researched, and knownis done so by an observer. The brain is seen, dissected, experimented on,believed to be the cause of mental events … by the minds of scientists—andlikewise for the other sciences. (This is what those circular diagrams in thefirst chapter are trying to convey.) From that point of view, the brain isinside the mind rather than vice versa. And it is from that point of view thatphenomenology throws down the gauntlet and challenges cognitive science, thusinitiating, though by no means closing, our conversation. 

4) “Mindfulness”training derived from Buddhist practices has been shown to have both physicallyand mentally therapeutic effects, and use of it is spreading exponentially.There is a corresponding outpouring of research on mindfulness not only toconfirm its clinical effectiveness but, as we might expect, to relate it to thebrain and to develop methods to define it, measure it, and to understand itwithin the framework of our already existing mechanistic science. Such work hasbeen anointed with names like contemplative clinical scienceand contemplative neuroscience, and one can only hopethat this will be a case of “If you build it [here “if you name it”] they willcome.” One positive result is that Buddhism and the large family of conceptsbeing called “mindfulness” are no longer treated as visits from anextraterrestrial as they were twenty-five years ago; both are now—howeverpoorly understood—on the cultural and scientific radar. On the other hand, muchthat Buddhism and contemplative practices in other traditions could contributeto science, not to mention human life (some might say the heart of what theyhave to contribute), is being overlooked or downright banished in the name ofscience. 

5) The theory ofenaction has itself developed. It has been refined and more clearly described(Evan Thompson has been the leader in this),[1](#FN1_2)and there have been advances in knowledge of the phenomenological background ofthe theory. Of most interest to cognitive scientists, enaction is gainingtraction as a philosophical paradigm and has staked claims to be a scientificprogram under which research can be performed.[2](#FN2_2)

In the rest of thisessay I will: 1) summarize the clarified version of enaction—twenty years ofemails from confused readers of chapter 8 have shown how needed this is; 2)show how understanding enaction in full requires input from Buddhism, includingits later forms; 3) appraise the new concept of Buddhist modernism being usedin academia to delegitimize serious study of living Buddhism; 4) critique theresearch on mindfulness that is in vogue and suggest alternatives; 5) discussthe enaction–science interface; and 6) open questions about futurecontemplative neuroscience and the future of enaction. 

## EnactionClarified 

### Phase1 Enaction 

Enaction can beunderstood in two stages. The core idea of enaction is that the living body isa self-organizing system. This is in contrast to viewing it as a machine thathappens to be made of meat rather than silicon. Mechanisms act and change theirstate only because of input and programming from sources outside of themselves,whereas the living body continuously reorganizes itself to survive and maintainits own homeostasis. (Notice how this alone is a radical departure from thedominant view of the body in present research.) Survival means that theorganism must preserve the integrity of its boundaries while having constantinterchange with the environment. Even the simplest one-celled organismexchanges materials through the semipermeable membrane of its cell walls andperforms overt actions relevant to its self-maintenance, such as swimmingtoward a detectable food source or away from insupportable temperatures.Actions of the organism are thus purposive and have been said by enactivists tobe the embryonic forms of cognition, of mind, and even of values. 

The environmentof a given living body of whatever degree of complexity can only be what isknowable and known to its sense organs and cognitions, and that environment isin turn constantly changed by the organism’s actions on it—in the terms we usein the book, neither side is pregiven. The lived body, lived mind, and livedenvironment are all thus part of the same process, the process by which oneenacts one’s world (in phenomenology speak, “brings forth a world”). Humans, ofcourse, can enact self, boundaries, survival, environment, exchange, desire,and aversion into symbolic castles of great subtlety, but that does not changethe basic processes. 

This is a phase 1account of enaction. It seems self-contained as it is; what need is there forBuddhism? In fact a description of sentient beings almost identical to theabove portrayal of enaction is provided in the teaching of the five skandhas (heaps) of early Buddhism. We present the skandhasin chapter 4 as an example of the Buddhist deconstruction of the self, but theycan also be seen as a logical and temporal account of how the false sense ofself is constructed. It begins with a living body with its dualistic senses;develops through that living being’s perception of the world through the filterof what is felt to be good, bad, or indifferent for the subject pole of thedualism; develops yet further into habits based on actions to get the good,shun the bad, and ignore the indifferent; and ends with birth into a moment ofconsciousness already situated in a complete inner and outer “world” stemmingfrom whichever of the basic impulses (desire, aversion, or indifference) of thesubject toward its objects predominates.[3](#FN3_2) But there isone major difference between the phase 1 enactive and the Buddhist accounts: inBuddhism, this is the beginning of the story, not the end. 

### Phase2 Enaction 

From the Buddhist pointof view, both phase 1 enaction and the skandhas are portraits of the confusedand ignorant body, mind, and world that is called samsara,that is, the wheel of life through which sentient beings cycle in ignorance andsuffering (see chapters 4 and 6). The good news is that there is analternative. There is another mode of knowing not based on an observer andobserved. This ushers in phase 2 of enaction, what in the book we call groundlessness (chapter 10). 

At this point we havegone beyond phenomenology. Yes, this is a controversial claim given Heidegger’saccount of Being-in-the-World (in-der-Welt-sein)where there is no split between subject, object, consciousness, and world,[4](#FN4_2) followed by Merleau-Ponty’s psychology that extendsthis foundational idea.5 Added tothese are the new interpretations of Husserl based partly on material of hisnot available when our book was originally written.[6](#FN6_2)But there is a difference between such ideas as philosophy or scientific theoryand what results from the actuality of a mind in the nondual awareness that canbe brought about (uncovered is probably a betterterm) by Buddhist meditations, contemplations, transmissions, and otherpractices. 

Here is the difference.In foundational European phenomenology (for convenience I will use Heidegger’sterminology), the central image of a mind that does not make distinctionsbetween subject and object, that is, of a mind in the pre-reflective natural state,is of a person actively engaged in the world, a person with interests, cares,concerns, and goals who is vigorously pursuing those goals using whatever comesbefore him as a tool. It is when there is some breakdown in that state(something doesn’t work) that the person will draw back, assume the abstractattitude, reflect on experience, and give birth to those distinctions. From theBuddhist point of view, this is a romanticization of samsara. What thatactively engaged person is engaged in is vigorously trying to grasp and clingto what he wants, flee from or attack what he does not want, and ignore what hefeels is irrelevant to himself—all while using objects, other people, and theenvironment only as instruments to foster his desires. The opposition betweenself and other is not a matter of abstract reflection but is built into theengagements of a consciousness birthed via the skandhas or, in our terminology,enacted without awareness of its nature. When theunaware person is actively, even skillfully or harmoniously, engaged in hislife, he is generally in a state of absorption, his mind cushioned by a cloudof fragmented perceptions, attentions, intentions, fantasies, thoughts,efforts, feelings, and memories that give him the sense of who he is and whathe is about, but do not make him fully present (in Buddhist terms he is in “theghostly confusion of phenomenal existence”). And when that person attempts tostop and look at his experience, the shadow of an ever present but slipperyseparate observer already present in the cloud comes to the fore, another kindof fragmented duality that makes it difficult to look. There is no first personhere and only a ghostly sense of any second or third person. 

What Buddhist practiceshave to contribute to this conundrum is that there is a different mode ofknowing altogether in which the mind is neither absorbed nor separated butsimply present and available. There is no longer that observer claimed in thefirst chapter here; experience is simple and self-known. This is the mind thatcan actually know firsthand the groundlessness of the enacted edifice in whichhumans live (chapter 10), thereby clearing the way for transformative wisdom toemerge (hinted at in chapter 11). (A note to phenomenologists: if Nishida andNishitani[7](#FN7_2) appear to be counterexamples towhat I have said in general about phenomenology, remember that both arespeaking from a background of Japanese Zen Buddhism.) 

What next? The title ofour book promises insight into the relation between personal experience andcognitive science, perhaps even a rapprochement between them. Enaction wasproposed as the form of cognitive science that could accomplish this. What isthere to say about such claims now twenty-five years later? I will discuss theexperience side first, and then the science. 

## PersonalExperience: Why Buddhism? 

If you are going to lookinto personal experience in a manner sufficiently rigorous to make it relevantto science, you need some method for doing so. We turned to Buddhism because,in our judgment, it provided what both Western psychology and phenomenologylacked, a disciplined and non-manipulative method of allowing the mind to knowitself—a method that we (in retrospect naively) simply called mindfulness. There are currently two main objections tousing Buddhism in this manner that need to be addressed. 

The first is called Buddhist modernism.Buddhism has changed throughout its history, and a recent book, The Making of Buddhist Modernism,[8](#FN8_1)has argued for a link between changes occurring in Buddhism since its contactwith the West and aspects of modern Western culture. Interestingly, althoughthe evaluative import of the historical data detailed in this wide-ranging workis sufficiently ambiguous that it could have led equally to the title The Decline and Fall of Buddhism or to TheMaking of the Buddhist Renaissance, the Buddhist studies community seemsto have landed primarily on the negative side to the point of using the term Buddhist modernism almost as an epithet. From thisviewpoint our assumption that Buddhist teachings are related to Buddhistmeditations and that both can reveal important aspects of the mind is itselfjust another expression of Buddhist modernism.[9](#FN9_1)

I come to these issuesnot from a context of historical scholarship but from the study of Buddhism asa living tradition and from a background in psychology and the cognitive andsocial sciences. That makes for a different lens. There is a sharp contrast,for example, between the ways Buddhist texts are treated by academic scholarsand by contemporary Buddhist practitioners. Some of the Buddhist doctrines,texts, and teachings that the scholar would claim unrelated to meditation experience(because meditation was so rare historically and/or because Buddhist treatisesand classification systems bear the marks of ordinary scholastic discourse) Isee being used in contemporary Buddhist centers as guides to meditation,pointers to experience, and programs for action in life. Furthermore, if youlook again at the textual record you find that the attribution of doctrinalorigins to meditative realization is not new but actually as old as thecanonical story of the Buddha himself, a pattern that is repeated in the originstories of major texts and the hagiographies of important teachers throughoutBuddhist history. If not a reality, it was certainly an ideal, as wasmeditation itself. In contemporary Buddhist sanghas(communities), there is often a core of dedicated practitioners who are workingtoward such ideals in their meditation—also their lives and community—and someconsider themselves pioneers in a Buddhist renewal. It is easy to miss suchcommunities if sidetracked by the penumbra of new age and other culturalbanalities that tend to surround contemporary Buddhist movements—a cautionarynote about judging contemporary activities from too great a distance. 

Of course neithermeditation nor writing is ever done in a vacuum. Previous texts and teachingsprovide the view for what is to be done and the rationale for why; meditationsand life practices provide the experience to instantiate or amend what wasgiven; and out of that will come new teachers and, perhaps, new teachings, allof this at play within the social structures and background of cultural beliefsand practices of the time. Buddhists look on this as natural, not as somehow adisconfirmation of their teachings. In fact it is considered part of theskillful means of a realized teacher to be able, in response to the needs ofpeople of a particular time and place, to generate new meditation techniques(as occurred in the burst of creativity in Theravada countries upon liberationfrom colonial rule), new teachings (such as Shambhala and Socially EngagedBuddhism), and perhaps new social structures for the sangha (as in Shambhalaand Sarvodaya Shramadana). Evan Thompson describes this kind of cycling backand forth in enactive language in his introduction; in Buddhism it is known as path.

The second mainobjection to our use of Buddhism as a window into personal experience is avariant of the general argument that experience cannot be used as a basis forresearch either in science or religious studies (in psychology, for example,this is the view that gave rise to behaviorism). The particular form of thisview leveled at us is the phenomenological objection that by looking atexperience closely or in any other particular way, one is thereby changing theexperience[10](#FN10_1) (an argument that would applyequally, of course, to phenomenological investigation). For Buddhism thiscritique is a confusion of path with results and a misunderstanding of thenature and purpose of path meditation. 

From the nondualperspective there is no you looking inwardly at a separate experience, but fromthe beginner’s dualistic viewpoint there appears to be; thus meditationinstructions make use of the marvelous human capacity to move one’s attentionin order to direct that attention in ways that will revealaspects of experience hitherto unnoticed or unacknowledged. For example, apractitioner may be told to attend to her breath as it goes in and out. Shortlyshe sees that this is difficult; her mind leaps around and she cannot control oreven find the looker. Here you find the seeds of later recognition ofimpermanence (the movement) and egolessness (no separated looker to look). Suchdiscoveries are not about particular contents of experience but of parametersof its nature, and they are the necessary forerunners for even a glimpse of thenonduality of the Madhyamaka as direct experience rather than only asphilosophical theory. 

## Scienceand Buddhism 

Because Buddhistpractices involve working with experience, one would expect the science–Buddhisminterchange to be a poster child for what we have asked for in a dialoguebetween experience and science. Instead it may presently be a cautionary tale. 

### Mindfulness

In the years since wewrote our book, the word mindfulness has achievedrock star status and attracted an exponentially expanding amount of research.Various trends have fed into this. In 1979 Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University ofMassachusetts Medical Center put together a pioneering program consisting oftwo Theravada mindfulness meditations, hatha yoga, and a number of exercisesallied to Western clinical techniques. He called the program Mindfulness BasedStress Reduction (MBSR)[11](#FN11_1) and it provedremarkably successful at helping chronic pain patients who had hitherto beenfinding no relief from standard medical techniques. Since then the use ofmindfulness in therapies, many modeled on MBSR, has burgeoned, withcorresponding research showing its benefits for a large variety of physical andpsychological ills as well as benefits for people without clinical diagnoses.[12](#FN12_1) A further encouragement for research has comethrough support from His Holiness the Dalai Lama who holds conferences in whichhe dialogues with Western scientists and supports research in other waysthrough his Mind and Life Institute. 

There are endemic problemswith research on mindfulness. My coauthor has provided a critique of this workthrough the perspective of enaction; here I want to indicate briefly some ofits weaknesses as ordinary science. It is basic scientific logic that if youwant to study the effect of something (the independent variable) on a resultantmental or physical state (the dependent variable), you have to know what theindependent variable is and have evidence that it is actually present in yoursubjects. You must also be able to define and measure the appropriate outcomevariables(s). However, defining and measuring mindfulness, as either kind ofvariable, is problematic. Even in early Buddhism there were debates over justwhat kinds of attention constituted mindfulness (Pali: sati,Sanskrit: smrti) and about what other virtues were orwere not to be included in it.[13](#FN13_1) The situationtoday is even more intricate since some teachers in all the forms of Buddhismhave begun to use the word mindfulness to refer toeverything from the most beginning practice to their version of presence with afully enlightened mind. Therapists contribute their own mindfulnessdescriptions, as do popular authors in a variety of genres. Researchers usuallysettle on a single verbal definition, perhaps from another researcher, withoutconsidering what it might imply or questioning whether their subjects are infact doing that. 

Here are some of theproblems with the resultant research:[14](#FN14_1) 1) The major mindfulnessmeasurement scales basically measure Western mental health variables withlittle reference to any of its prior meanings. Not only does this elide whatmight be new and interesting about mindfulness, but methodologically theoperational definition of mindfulness becomes the same thing as the desired outcome of being mindful—a circular process. 2) A widelyused de facto definition of mindfulness is that subjects have taken MBSR, butthe genius of that multifaceted program is that people can benefit from it inmany different ways,[15](#FN15_1) and so benefits may well notcorrespond to the researcher’s definition of mindfulness. 3) If a would-bemindfulness instruction is given, and subjects show a brain response, it isassumed that this is the brain signature of mindfulness—but as every meditatorknows, instruction is not equivalent to performance, and as everyneuroscientist is coming to know, anything that one does affects the brain. 4)Mindfulness is often treated as a mechanism, a pill that should work in thesame way regardless of context, but, as we have seen (and as is basic inenaction), context is important in how people interpret and proceed with whatthey are doing—even for pills. 

Perhaps the finalindignity is that when researchers come to explain mindfulness, they inevitablyassimilate it to an already established and well-domesticated theory inclinical or, increasingly, brain science. This assumes that our scientificknowledge is already complete with nothing new to learn. Is it? 

### BeyondMindfulness: Basic Knowledge Questions 

Are the mind and itsexperiences only the brain? Is the mind limited to the body? Mainstreamneuroscience assumes the affirmative to both questions, but the only evidencefor that position is that changes in the brain can affect experience andbehavior, and vice versa. To take such two-way interactions as a brain monismdepends on a scientific materialist metaphysics, not on science itself. It alsodepends on the assumption that we now know everything basic that there is toknow about matter and living bodies. And finally it assumes that there is nofaculty of knowing beyond the dualistic mind of samsara and phase 1 enaction. 

Evidence contrary tothese assumptions has been slowly accumulating for the past century. Best knownby Westerners are the alternative physiologies offered by the yogic (and Asianmedical) views of the body in which the body is regarded as a pattern ofenergy. The energy channels described in these systems do not correspond to thenervous system of Western physiology but can nonetheless be manipulated bytechniques such as acupuncture to produce both experiences and health benefits.In Tibetan Buddhism, inner subtle-body visualizations and guidance are a partof advanced practices, at least one of which, the inner heat practice of tummo, has readily observable physical effects; forexample, practitioners can raise their body temperature enough to sit infreezing temperatures and to dry wet sheets wrapped around them.[16](#FN16_1) Less dramatic, but perhaps more to the point, isthat movements of energy in the subtle body are understood in Hindu, Buddhist,and Daoist yogas to be the origin of mental effects, such as wildness versusstability of mind. In fact both later Buddhism and Daoism offer inner-energypaths that can transform both the actual embodiment of the practitioner and, ifcomprehended, could potentially transform the understanding of embodiment ofthe scientific community as a whole. Interestingly, hatha yoga and/or qi gongexercises form an integral, though in research generally ignored, part of MBSRand thus may play a correspondingly important role in its health benefits. Inshort, what we have here is an organized and detailed alternative map of a body-mind,consonant with enaction, that cries out for serious scientific investigation.[17](#FN17_1) 

Even more scientificallychallenging is evidence that there could be aspects of mind that are separablefrom the brain and perhaps even the body. Tibetan lamas give mind-to-mindtransmission of various kinds of wisdom states. Unlike the design of multitudesof failed extra sensory perception experiments in the West, such transmissionsare not of mental contents but of what are considered deeper aspects of mind.Although the transmissions are not conveyed by ordinary sensory or intellectualmeans, they can be experienced—as is attested by many Western students ofTibetan teachers. Less exotic phenomena such as experimenter bias or placebo effectsmay or may not be in the same category as this. 

Evidence for separation of the deep mind from the brain occurs in evenmore paradigm-challenging circumstances. At death Tibetan high lamas enter intowhat is called the death samadhi. The lama is medicallydead: no brain activity, no organ activity, but his heart center remains warm,and transmissions of enlightened mind states can emanate from him even morestrongly and clearly than in life. This may continue for days, even weeks orlonger. The Vajrayana yogic explanation is that the subtlest energies of thenondual mind have withdrawn from the outer body into the central channel, havethen united in the heart center, and are now radiating to the world.[18](#FN18_1) Typically when the lama’s mind, in its most subtleyogic sense, is judged to have merged with the dharmakaya(the fundamental ground of being), and his body is cremated, rainbows appear. Ihave witnessed all of this twice; it definitely shakes one’s scientificpreconceptions. 

## Scienceand Enaction 

The idea of the mind asembodied—now generally called embodied cognition—hasbecome an active field of research, often hailed by its adherents as the newparadigm for cognitive science. Such research occurs under a loosely knit consortiumof headings that include: embodied cognition, enaction, embedded cognition,extended mind, grounded cognition, situated cognition, nonrepresentationalcognition, emergent cognition, and anti-Cartesian cognition. The differences inname, to some extent, map differences in theoretical orientation and researchmethods. Thus you can see that enaction, in its particulars, has now become onepart of a more general scientific movement. Interestingly, TheEmbodied Mind is commonly cited as one origin of this entire movement. 

All of this makes senseif one thinks in terms of the sociology of science. New theories should notonly be able to generate multiple experimental or observational results thatolder theories could not, but they are even more likely to gain prominence ifthey are in direct opposition to those previous theories. In cognitive scienceand psychology it helps if some of the new results are provocatively, perhapscharmingly, counterintuitive. Embodied cognition meets all of these criteria. Itsets itself in clear opposition to what it sees as the prevailing stance incognitive science and psychology, that is, cognitivism and computationalmethods that abstract mental performance from the full functioning of the bodyin its environment (see chapter 3). It is likewise in adamant disagreement withthe mind seen as a product of the brain alone. From this quite general basis(perhaps “battle cry” in Wittgenstein’s sense), it is relatively easy togenerate a torrent of experiments and studies by showing that a particularmovement of the body or interaction with the physical or social environmentmakes a measurable difference in cognition or vice versa, all of which count asconfirmation of the basic proposition of embodiment. A final spur to interestin embodiment as a new paradigm is its ability to generate surprise. Oneexample: holding a cup of warm versus cold liquid in one hand changes howexperimental subjects evaluate other unrelated stimuli. 

The content of what isbeing studied and of what is or is not considered confirmation varies with theparticular theory and aspects of embodiment under consideration—as might beexpected from the proliferation of names for embodiment. However, the overallrelationship of these differing perspectives to one another is more like anextended family than an adversarial court case; the adults (the theories) maybicker and dispute, but the children (the experiments) can be shared. In fact,older experimental work, particularly in psychology, done under rather differentauspices, may be repurposed as examples of embodiment, cognitive dissonancebeing one obvious example. 

Enaction as such hasfared well in this environment. It has not lost its integrity amid the otherforms of embodied cognition and has maintained its close association withphenomenological thought. Enaction brings a distinctive perspective into theembodiment conversation. Whereas most embodiment research focuses on theinteraction between body and mind, body and environment, or environment and mind,enaction sees the lived body as a single system that encompasses all three.19 Systems analysis thus becomesthe basic framework that guides much enaction research. Although at its mostabstract theoretical level enaction could be considered a philosophy too broadto be subject to empirical testing (is there anything that cannot be interpreted in an enactive framework?), at present acoterie of enthusiastic enactivists are finding ways to translate thatoverarching view into hierarchies of increasingly specific descriptions,hypotheses, and mechanisms that at their most concrete can connect withscience.[20](#FN20_1) 

Work on socialinteraction appears emblematic of enaction research and can illustrate thisprocess. Embodied social interaction is seen as “mutual participatorysense-making.” How is this to be translated into specifics? In the first placeit is mutual and thus system based; thisdifferentiates it strongly from theory-of-mind and other current models thatplace the internal cognition of individuals (who must use verbal and physicalcues to guess one another’s states of mind) as the nexus of social dynamics.Second it is participatory; the participants who areinteracting are doing something, thereby creating a system that is changing.Such systems can be subjected to a dynamical systems analysis using variableswithin that method such as dynamical transitions in coordination patterns.Finally there is sense-making, which is defined asthe ongoing emergence of roles, values, dispositions to act, and meanings.These terms could potentially be given operational definitions and then bemeasured by whatever methods are available considering the species under studyand other particulars of the situation. Because all of this is seen as enabledby lower-level mechanisms in the body and brain, a universe of possibilities isopened for specific hypotheses and research. For example, according to theenactive “interactive brain hypothesis,”[21](#FN21_1) the brain isprimarily an organ of relational cognition. Thus it has evolved so thatorganisms have “quasi-automatic attunement to others.” Evidence for this can begathered from a wide range of sources, from the stereotypical threat displaysand maternal behaviors of many species to the brain patterns of humans thatcharacterize being “ready to act.” While much of the experimental researchpresently cited in enaction papers comes from work previously performed withintheoretical frameworks remote from enaction, increasingly studies are appearingthat are inspired (at least in part) by enaction itself. 

## The Future 

### Neuroscienceand the Mind 

In TheStructure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argues that scienceproceeds by increments within a given accepted paradigm until the usefulness ofthat paradigm for new discoveries wanes, and observations that do not fitaccumulate sufficiently to force a shift to a new paradigm. At this particularjuncture of historical time, discovering brain correlates of experience is newenough to enthrall researchers and the public alike and to appear to explaineverything. But ten years from now? Richard Davidson, a pioneer in brainresearch on emotions and on mindfulness puts it this way: “… it wasn’t thatsurprising that meditation produces distinct patterns of brain activity. Thatgoes without saying—anything the mind and therefore the brain does is marked byspecific patterns of neuronal firing in specific areas, just as your muscleshave particular patterns of electrical activity when you work out.”[22](#FN22_1) Davidson is looking for changes that last overtime and are part of a more general theoretical understanding. We can predictthat increasingly the dialogue between experience and science called for by The Embodied Mind will require more than finding simplebrain correlates of mental activity. 

Meanwhile observationsthat do not fit the mind-is-only-brain (or even mind-is-only-body) paradigm arebuilding. In recent years, two books have thoughtfully addressed this issue.Edward Kelly and Emily Kelly[23](#FN23_1) provide acompendium of well-documented case studies and experiments indicating that themind is something in its own right apart from the brain. Some examples are:extreme psychosomatic effects, out-of-body experiences during clinical deathwhile undergoing surgery, feats of Hindu yogis who remained alive and cognizantfor long periods with heartbeat and respiration suspended, physiologicalchanges induced by hypnosis, and many others. The death samadhi of Tibetanlamas is the most extreme example. Charles Tart[24](#FN24_1)offers a similarly motivated collection. He also ranks categories of suchparadigm-challenging phenomena as to how well documented they are. 

What would put thesepresently marginal studies center stage, of course, would be if physics were todiscover something measurable about the mind, apart from the brain, that fitwithin the ever-expanding domain of what is considered material. We now haveparticles without mass, dark energy, bosons of various types, and, at leasttheoretically, vibrating strings of energy that constitute the universe—howabout massless mentons that operate within a mentalenergy field? Not impossible; we don’t know everything. 

### TheFuture of Enaction 

Enaction occupies aliminal and potentially fertile place in cognitive science. It is a philosophythat is shape shifting into science. As such it may be unique, but it runs somerisks. One of the signatures of enactive language, inherited fromphenomenology, is its ability to evoke a sense of humanity and deep respect forlife. But as it reaches the level of specificity where it is reframed into theimpersonal world of dynamic systems analysis, brain mechanisms, and so on, itcan easily lose the mind/experience aspect of the lived body and drift toward abody-based reductionist materialism much like brain reductionism. Retaininginput from Buddhism or one of the other contemplative traditions could behelpful for anchoring it in its original roots. 

Enaction would also dowell to continue to expand its analysis of the processes that psychology calls “higher-level cognition.” In complex organisms likehumans, how does the principle of self-organization (survival, boundaries,exchange with environments, purposiveness) relate to the multiple and possiblyhierarchical systems that make up the body and mind? How does enaction accountfor and work in relation to symbol systems, language, and all of the vastsymbolic extensions of the human definition of self and its boundaries? Andwhat is it that breaks down in pathologies of self-organization andself-maintenance such as autoimmune disease, cancers, and emotive thoughtpatterns so self-destructive that they may even lead to suicide?[25](#FN25_1) What might enaction have to say about socialsystems and their pathologies or about other challenging societal endeavorssuch as warfare and peace negotiations? 

Is there a place in allthis, either in the philosophy or science of enaction, for its type 2counterpart? At present, this would seem to rest on the intelligence andawareness of individual people. For example, there are forms of therapeuticbodywork based on the principle of self-organization and possiblereorganization,[26](#FN26_1) but beyond the theory, what is sostriking about them is that from numerous case studies and patient narratives,one can see the therapist, operating perhaps from a vantage point past theordinary restricted consciousness of phase 1 enaction, reaching out to connectwith the inner intelligence of the client and probing for what will initiatethe needed reorganization. The same can probably be said for founders andskilled practitioners of other kinds of therapies. For example, the Bill Moyersdocumentary on MBSR[27](#FN27_1) reveals Kabat-Zinn as an inspiredand inspiring teacher who is tangibly conveying more to his patients than anysimple automated technique. Perhaps the extreme of this kind of intelligence isthe presence felt from some religious teachers whose wisdom seems to go wellbeyond their doctrine—a specialty of Tibetan lamas whose ability to functionand palpably transmit beyond concepts is almost part of their job description.And, of course, in our not-yet-very-enlightened society, it is at the level ofthe individual that some people will be able to break out of the constraints ofdynamically escalating destructive interactive systems (such as domesticquarrels, obedience-to-authority psychology experiments, and group aggression).Something of this type of vision may also be needed for scientists; that is,researchers need to be able to look at their subject matter from a position ofunderstanding beyond where their field already is in order to make creativecontributions. 

### EndingNote 

For a real dialogue (ortrialogue) to occur, all sides need to speak and be heard equally. That has nothappened yet for the topics we explore in The Embodied Mind.Where science, as it is done now with its mechanistic and materialistassumptions, meets experience, Buddhism, or anything else, the science simplytakes over like a colonial ruler. This is body imperialism, not dialogue. Itneed not always be that way. There is also a quantity of goodwill beinggenerated, and that could become fertile ground for a more responsive future. 

We have offered enactionas a form of science that may help bridge the communication gap betweenexperience and science. It will not do this automatically. Ideas such as thelived body and enaction can easily become merely a romanticization of the oldparadigm of a corporeal form limited to self-survival and self-aggrandizement;on the other hand, such ideas could be a transition to a new paradigm for whatbody and mind are altogether. The key to progress is to keep an open mind—andwhile we are at it, it would not hurt to also have an open heart. Actually thatis good advice for doing anything, including reading this book. So bon voyage,and enjoy!

# Acknowledgments 

The inspiration for thisbook began in the late seventies when Francisco Varela was teaching at thesummer Science Program of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. NaropaInstitute tried to create an intellectual space for a dialogue between thecognitive sciences and the Buddhist traditions of meditative psychology andphilosophy by offering a variety of courses and by gathering teachers andstudents for discussion in an informal atmosphere. In this enterprise and inthe ideas that grew from it, the contributions of Newcomb Greenleaf, RobinKornman, Jeremy Hayward, Michael Moerman, Joseph Goguen, and Charlotte Lindewere invaluable. In 1979, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded what wasprobably the very first conference on “Contrasting Perspectives on Cognition:Buddhism and the Cognitive Sciences.” This conference, which gathered scholarsfrom various universities in North America and Buddhist scholars from manyschools and traditions, was so unsuccessful in establishing a genuine dialoguethat we learned a great deal about how not to go about the exploration. 

Over the next few yearsFrancisco Varela continued to work privately on developing the dialogue betweencognitive science and the Buddhist tradition, only occasionally presentingideas in public. One particularly helpful discussion took place as a series oftalks given in 1985 at Karma Choeling in Vermont. 

The overall shape ofthis book first came into being when Evan Thompson, supported by a research grantfrom the Stiftung Zur Förderung der Philosophie (Germany), joined FranciscoVarela at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in the summer of 1986. During thistime a tentative first draft of the book was completed. We are grateful to theStiftung and to Uri Kuchinsky for support during this period. 

In the fall of 1987, theideas of this first draft were presented at another conference on cognitivescience and Buddhism, this one held at the Cathedral Church of St. John theDivine in New York City and organized by the Lindisfarne Program for Biology,Cognition, and Ethics. We are especially grateful to William I. Thompson and tothe Very Reverend James Parks Morton for their interest and support of ourwork. 

From 1987 to 1989,Varela and Thompson continued writing in Paris, supported by grants to theLindisfarne Program for Biology, Cognition, and Ethics from the PrinceCharitable Trusts of Chicago. In the fall of 1989, Eleanor Rosch, who had beenteaching and doing research in both cognitive psychology and Buddhistpsychology for many years at Berkeley, joined the project as a third author. In1990–91, Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, working sometimes together and sometimesat a distance in Berkeley, Paris, Toronto, and Boston, produced several furtherdrafts, resulting finally in this book. 

Over the years, a greatmany people have encouraged and supported our work. William I. Thompson, AmyCohen, and Jeremy Hayward were untiring in their advice, encouragement, andfriendly criticism on virtually every aspect of the book. The comments andsupport of Mauro Cerutti, Jean-Pierre Depuy, Fernando Flores, Gordon Globus,and Susan Oyama were also especially helpful. Several other people read variousdrafts and/or portions of the manuscript and offered valuable comments: inparticular, Dan Dennett, Gail Fleischaker, Tamar Gendler, Dan Goleman, and LisaLloyd. Finally, special thanks are due to Frank Urbanowski of The MIT Press forbelieving in this book, and to Madeline Sunley and Jenya Weinreb for their carein handling the revisions and production. 

In addition to those already mentioned, each of us wishes to addseveral personal acknowledgments:

# Introduction 

This book begins andends with the conviction that the new sciences of mind need to enlarge theirhorizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities fortransformation inherent in human experience. Ordinary, everyday experience, onthe other hand, must enlarge its horizon to benefit from the insights andanalyses that are distinctly wrought by the sciences of mind. It is thispossibility for circulation between the sciences of mind (cognitive science)and human experience that we explore in this book. 

If we examine thecurrent situation today, with the exception of a few largely academicdiscussions cognitive science has had virtually nothing to say about what itmeans to be human in everyday, lived situations. On the other hand, those humantraditions that have focused on the analysis, understanding, and possibilitiesfor transformation of ordinary life need to be presented in a context thatmakes them available to science. 

We like to consider ourjourney in this book as a modern continuation of a program of research foundedover a generation ago by the French philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty.[1](#1_1) By continuation we do notmean a scholarly consideration of Merleau-Ponty’s thought in the context ofcontemporary cognitive science. We mean, rather, that Merleau-Ponty’s writingshave both inspired and guided our orientation here. 

We hold withMerleau-Ponty that Western scientific culture requires that we see our bodiesboth as physical structures and as lived, experiential structures—in short, asboth “outer” and “inner,” biological and phenomenological. These two sides ofembodiment are obviously not opposed. Instead, we continuously circulate backand forth between them. Merleau-Ponty recognized that we cannot understand thiscirculation without a detailed investigation of its fundamental axis, namely,the embodiment of knowledge, cognition, and experience. For Merleau-Ponty, asfor us, embodiment has this double sense: itencompasses both the body as a lived, experiential structure and the body asthe context or milieu of cognitive mechanisms. 

Embodiment in thisdouble sense has been virtually absent from cognitive science, both inphilosophical discussion and in hands-on research. We look to Merleau-Ponty,then, because we claim that we cannot investigate the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience without making this double sense ofembodiment the focus of our attention. This claim is not primarilyphilosophical. On the contrary, our point is that both the development ofresearch in cognitive science and the relevance of this research to lived humanconcerns require the explicit thematization of this double sense of embodiment.This book is meant as a first step in this task. 

Although we look toMerleau-Ponty for inspiration, we nonetheless recognize that our present-daysituation is significantly different from his. There are at least two reasonsfor this difference, one from science and the other from human experience. 

First, in the days whenMerleau-Ponty undertook his work—the 1940s and 1950s—the potential sciences ofmind were fragmented into disparate, noncommunicating disciplines: neurology,psychoanalysis, and behaviorist experimental psychology. Today we see theemergence of a new interdisciplinary matrix called cognitive science, whichincludes not only neuroscience but cognitive psychology, linguistics,artificial intelligence, and, in many centers, philosophy. Furthermore, most ofcognitive technology, which is essential for thecontemporary science of mind, has been developed only in the past fortyyears—the digital computer being the most significant example. 

Second, Merleau-Ponty addressedthe lived world of human experience from the philosophical standpointelaborated in the tradition of phenomenology. There are many direct heirs tophenomenology in the contemporary scene. In France, the tradition of Heideggerand Merleau-Ponty is continued in authors such as Michel Foucault, JacquesDerrida, and Pierre Bourdieu.[2](#2_1) In North America, Hubert Dreyfus has long been theHeideggerian gadfly of the cognitive science enterprise,[3](#3_1)more recently joined in that critique by others who link it to variousscientific domains, such as Terry Winograd, Fernando Flores,[4](#4_1)Gordon Globus,[5](#5_1) and John Haugeland.[6](#6_1)In another direction, phenomenology as ethnomethodology has been recentlypursued in the studies of improvisation by D. Sudnow.[7](#7_1)Finally, phenomenology has given its name to a tradition within clinicalpsychology.[8](#c0_note_8) These approaches, however, aredependent upon the methods of their parent disciplines—the logicalarticulations of philosophy, interpretive analysis of history and of sociology,and the treatment of patients in therapy. 

Despite this activity,phenomenology remains—especially in North America, where an important volume ofcurrent research in cognitive science is being done—a relatively uninfluentialphilosophical school. We believe that it is time for a radically new approachto the implementation of Merleau-Ponty’s vision. What we are offering in thisbook is thus a new lineage of descent from the fundamental intuition of doubleembodiment first articulated by Merleau-Ponty. 

What challenges doeshuman experience face as a result of the scientific study of mind? Theexistential concern that animates our entire discussion in this book resultsfrom the tangible demonstration within cognitive science that the self orcognizing subject is fundamentally fragmented, divided, or nonunified. Thisrealization is, of course, not new to Western culture. Many philosophers,psychiatrists, and social theorists since Nietzsche have challenged ourreceived conception of the self or subject as the epicenter of knowledge,cognition, experience, and action. The emergence of this theme within science,however, marks a quite significant event, for science provides the voice ofauthority in our culture to an extent that is matched by no other humanpractice and institution. Furthermore, science—again unlike other humanpractices and institutions—incarnates its understanding in technological artifacts.In the case of cognitive science, these artifacts are ever more sophisticatedthinking/acting machines, which have the potential to transform everyday lifeperhaps even more than the books of the philosopher, the reflections of thesocial theorist, or the therapeutic analyses of the psychiatrist. 

This central andfundamental issue—the status of the self or cognizing subject—could, of course,be relegated to a purely theoretical pursuit. Nevertheless, this issueobviously touches our lives and self-understanding directly. It is thereforenot at all surprising that those few eloquent books that do engage this issue,such as Hofstadter and Dennett’s The Mind’s Eye andSherry Turkle’s The Second Self, meet withconsiderable popularity.[9](#9_1) In a more academic vein, the circulation betweenscience and experience has surfaced in discussions of “folk psychology” or informs of investigation such as “conversational analysis.” An even moresystematic attempt to address the relation between science and experience canbe found in the recent book by Ray Jackendoff, Consciousnessand the Computational Mind,[10](#10_1)which addresses the relation between science and experience by attempting toprovide a computational foundation for the experience of conscious awareness. 

Although we share theconcerns of these various works, we remain dissatisfied with both theirprocedures and their answers. Our view is that the current style ofinvestigation is limited and unsatisfactory, both theoretically andempirically, because there remains no direct, hands-on, pragmaticapproach to experience with which to complement science. As a result, both thespontaneous and more reflective dimensions of human experience receive littlemore than a cursory, matter-of-fact treatment, one that is no match for thedepth and sophistication of scientific analysis. 

How do we propose toremedy this situation? Considerable evidence gathered in many contexts throughouthuman history indicates both that experience itself can be examined in adisciplined manner and that skill in such an examination can be considerablyrefined over time. We refer to the experience accumulated in a tradition thatis not familiar to most Westerners but that the West can hardly continue toignore—the Buddhist tradition of meditative practice and pragmatic,philosophical exploration. Though considerably less familiar than otherpragmatic investigations of human experience, such as psychoanalysis, theBuddhist tradition is especially relevant to our concerns, for, as we shallsee, the concept of a nonunified or decentered (the usual terms are egoless or selfless) cognitivebeing is the cornerstone of the entire Buddhist tradition. Furthermore, thisconcept—although it certainly entered into philosophical debate in the Buddhisttradition—is fundamentally a firsthand experiential account by those who attaina degree of mindfulness of their experience in daily life. For these reasons,then, we propose to build a bridge between mind in science and mind inexperience by articulating a dialogue between these two traditions of Westerncognitive science and Buddhist meditative psychology. 

Let us emphasize thatthe overriding aim of our book is pragmatic. We do not intend to build somegrand, unified theory, either scientific or philosophical, of the mind-bodyrelation. Nor do we intend to write a treatise of comparative scholarship. Ourconcern is to open a space of possibilities in which the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience can be fully appreciated and to fosterthe transformative possibilities of human experience in a scientific culture.This pragmatic orientation is common to both partners in this book. On the onehand, science proceeds because of its pragmatic link to the phenomenal world;indeed, its validation is derived from the efficacy of this link. On the otherhand, the tradition of meditative practice proceeds because of its systematicand disciplined link to human experience. The validation of this tradition isderived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience andself-understanding. 

In writing this book, wehave aimed for a level of discussion that will be accessible to severalaudiences. Thus we have attempted to address not only working cognitivescientists but also educated laypersons with a general interest in the dialoguebetween science and experience, as well as those interested in Buddhist orcomparative thought. As a result, members of these different (and, we hope,overlapping) groups may occasionally wish that we had devoted more time to somespecific point in the scientific, philosophical, or comparative discussions. Wehave tried to anticipate a few of these points but have placed our comments innotes and appendixes so as not to detract from the flow of the discussion,which, once again, is intended for a wide audience. 

Now that we haveintroduced the reader to the main theme of this book, let us outline how itunfolds into five parts: 

·     Part I introduces the two partnersin our dialogue. We indicate what we mean by “cognitive science” and “humanexperience” and proide an overview of how the dialogue between these twopartners will develop. 

·     Part II presents the computationalmodel of mind, which gave rise to cognitive science in its classical form(cognitivism). Here we see how cognitive science uncovers the nonunity of thecognizing subject and how the progressive realization of a nonunified selfprovides the cornerstone of Buddhist meditative practice and of itspsychological articulation. 

·     Part III addresses the issue ofhow the phenomena usually attributed to a self could arise without an actualself. Within cognitive science, this encompasses the concepts of self-organizationand emergent properties of cognitive processes, especially in connectionist models. Within Buddhist psychology, it includes theemergent structure of mental factors within a single moment of experience andthe emergence of the karmic causal patterning of experience over time. 

·     Part IV provides a further step,which consists in the presentation of a new approach in cognitive science. Wepropose the term enactive for this new approach. Inthe enactive program, we explicitly call into question the assumption—prevalentthroughout cognitive science—that cognition consists of the representation of aworld that is independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities by acognitive system that exists independent of the world. We outline instead aview of cognition as embodied action and so recoverthe idea of embodiment that we invoked above. We also situate this view ofcognition within the context of evolutionary theory by arguing that evolutionconsists not in optimal adaptation but rather in what we call natural drift.This fourth step in our book may be the most creative contribution we have tooffer to contemporary cognitive science. 

·     Part V considers the philosophicaland experiential implications of the enactive view that cognition has noultimate foundation or ground beyond its history of embodiment. We firstsituate these implications within the context of the contemporary Westerncritique of objectivism and foundationalism. We then present what was probablythe most radically nonfoundationalist understanding in human history, theMadhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, the school on whose insights all majorsubsequent Buddhist thought has relied. We conclude our discussion byconsidering some of the more far-reaching ethical implications of the journeyundertaken in this book. Part V may be the most creative contribution that wehave to make within our larger cultural context. 

We intend these fiveparts to express an ongoing conversation in which we explore experience and themind within an expanded horizon that includes both the meditative attention toexperience in daily life and the scientific attention to mind in nature. Thisconversation is ultimately motivated by a concern: without embracing therelevance and importance of everyday, lived human experience, the power andsophistication of contemporary cognitive science could generate a dividedscientific culture in which our scientific conceptions of life and mind on theone hand, and our everyday, lived self-understanding on the other, becomeirreconciliable. Hence in our eyes, the issues at hand, though scientific andtechnical, are inseparable from deeply ethical concerns, ones that require anequally deep reunderstanding of the dignity of human life.

# [1 ]()AFundamental Circularity: In the Mind of the Reflective Scientist 

## AnAlready-Given Condition 

A phenomenologicallyinclined cognitive scientist reflecting on the origins of cognition mightreason thus: Minds awaken in a world. We did not design our world. We simplyfound ourselves with it; we awoke both to ourselves and to the world weinhabit. We come to reflect on that world as we grow and live. We reflect on aworld that is not made, but found, and yet it is also our structure thatenables us to reflect upon this world. Thus in reflection we find ourselves ina circle: we are in a world that seems to be there before reflection begins,but that world is not separate from us. 

For the Frenchphilosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the recognition of this circle opened up aspace between self and world, between the inner and the outer. This space wasnot a gulf or divide; it embraced the distinction between self and world, andyet provided the continuity between them. Its openness revealed a middle way,an entre-deux. In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty wrote, 

When I begin to reflect, my reflection bears upon an unreflectiveexperience, moreover my reflection cannot be unaware of itself as an event, andso it appears to itself in the light of a truly creative act, of a changedstructure of consciousness, and yet it has to recognize, as having priorityover its own operations, the world which is given to the subject because thesubject is given to himself. … Perception is not a science of the world, it isnot even an act, a deliberate taking up of a position; it is the backgroundfrom which all acts stand out, and is presupposed by them: The world is not anobject such that I have in my possession the law of its making; it is thenatural setting of, and field for, all my thoughts and all my explicitperceptions.[1](#1_3) 

And toward the end ofthe book, he wrote, “The world is inseparable from the subject, but from asubject which is nothing but a project of the world, and the subject isinseparable from the world, but from a world which the subject itselfprojects.”[2](#2_3) 

Science (and philosophyfor that matter) has chosen largely to ignore what might lie in such anentre-deux or middle way. Indeed, Merleau-Ponty could be held partlyresponsible, for in his Phenomenology at least, hesaw science as primarily unreflective; he argued that it naively presupposedmind and consciousness. Indeed, this is one of the extreme stances science cantake. The observor that a nineteenth-century physicist had in mind is oftenpictured as a disembodied eye looking objectively at the play of phenomena. Orto change metaphors, such an observor could be imagined as a cognizing agentwho is parachuted onto the earth as an unknown, objective reality to becharted. Critiques of such a position, however, can easily go to the oppositeextreme. The indeterminacy principle in quantum mechanics, for example, isoften used to espouse a kind of subjectivism in which the mind on its own“constructs” the world. But when we turn back upon ourselves to make our owncognition our scientific theme—which is precisely what the new science of cognition purports to do—neither of these positions (theassumption of a disembodied observor or of a dis-worlded mind) is at alladequate. 

We will return to adiscussion of this point shortly. At the moment, we wish to speak moreprecisely about this science that has come to take such a turn. What is thisnew branch of science? 

## WhatIs Cognitive Science? 

In its widest sense theterm cognitive science is used to indicate that thestudy of mind is in itself a worthy scientific pursuit.[3](#3_3)At this time cognitive science is not yet established as a mature science. Itdoes not have a clearly agreed upon sense of direction and a large number ofresearchers constituting a community, as is the case with, say, atomic physicsor molecular biology. Rather, it is really more of a loose affiliation of disciplinesthan a discipline of its own. Interestingly, an important pole is occupied byartificial intelligence—thus the computer model of the mind is a dominantaspect of the entire field. The other affiliated disciplines are generallytaken to consist of linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, sometimesanthropology, and the philosophy of mind. Each discipline would give a somewhatdifferent answer to the question of what is mind or cognition, an answer thatwould reflect its own specific concerns. The future development of cognitivescience is therefore far from clear, but what has already been produced has hada distinct impact, and this may well continue to be the case. 

From Alexandre Koyré toThomas Kuhn, modern historians and philosophers have argued that scientificimagination mutates radically from one epoch to another and that the history ofscience is more like a novelistic saga than a linear progression. In otherwords, there is a human history of nature, a story that is well worth tellingin more than one way. Alongside such a human history of nature there is acorresponding history of ideas about human self-knowledge. Consider, forexample, Greek physics and the Socratic method or Montaigne’s essays and earlyFrench science. This history of self-knowledge in the West remains to be fullyexplored. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that precursors of what we now callcognitive science have been with us all along, since the human mind is theclosest and most familiar example of cognition and knowledge. 

In this parallel historyof mind and nature, the modern phase of cognitive science may represent adistinct mutation. At this time, science (i.e., the collection of scientistswho define what science must be) not only recognizes that the investigation of knowledgeitself is legitimate but also conceives of knowledge in a broad,interdisciplinary perspective, well beyond the traditional confines ofepistemology and psychology. This mutation, only some thirty years old, wasdramatically introduced through the “cognitivist” program (discussed later),much as the Darwinian program inaugurated the scientific study of evolutioneven though others had been concerned with evolution before. 

Furthermore, throughthis mutation, knowledge has become tangibly and inextricably linked to atechnology that transforms the social practices which make that very knowledgepossible—artificial intelligence being the most visible example. Technology,among other things, acts as an amplifier. One cannot separate cognitive scienceand cognitive technology without robbing one or the other of its vitalcomplementary element. Through technology, the scientific exploration of mindprovides society at large with an unprecedented mirror of itself, well beyondthe circle of the philosopher, the psychologist, the therapist, or anyindividual seeking insight into his own experience. 

This mirror reveals thatfor the first time Western society as a whole is confronted in its everydaylife and activities with such issues as: Is mind a manipulation of symbols? Canlanguage be understood by a machine? These concerns directly touch people’slives; they are not merely theoretical. Thus it is hardly surprising that thereis a constant interest in the media about cognitive science and its associated technology and that artificial intelligencehas deeply penetrated the minds of the young through computer games and sciencefiction. This popular interest is a sign of a deep transformation: Formillennia human beings have had a spontaneous understanding of their ownexperience—one embedded in and nourished by the larger context of their timeand culture. Now, however, this spontaneous folk understanding has becomeinextricably linked to science and can be transformed by scientificconstructions. 

Many deplore this event,while others rejoice. What is undeniable is that the event is happening, and atan ever increasing speed and depth. We feel that the creative interpenetrationamong research scientists, technologists, and the general public holds apotential for the profound transformation of human awareness. We find thispossibility fascinating and see it as one of the most interesting adventuresopen to everyone today. We offer this book as (we hope) a meaningfulcontribution to that transformative conversation. 

Throughout this book, wewill emphasize the diversity of visions within cognitive science. In our eyes,cognitive science is not a monolithic field, though it does have, as does anysocial activity, poles of domination so that some of its participating voicesacquire more force than others at various periods of time. Indeed, thissociological aspect of cognitive science is striking, for the “cognitiverevolution” of the past four decades was strongly influenced through specificlines of research and funding in the United States. 

Nevertheless, our biashere will be to emphasize diversity. We propose to look at cognitive science asconsisting of three successive stages. These three stages will be taken up inparts II, III, and IV respectively. But to help orient the reader, we willprovide a short overview of these stages here. We have drawn them in the formof a “polar” map with three concentric rings ([figure 1.1](#fig_001)). The three stagescorrespond to the successive movement from center to periphery; each ringindicates an important shift in the theoretical framework within cognitivescience. Moving around the circle, we have placed the major disciplines thatconstitute the field of cognitive science. Thus we have a conceptual chart inwhich we can place the names of various researchers whose work is bothrepresentative and will appear in the discussion that follows.

[Figure 1.1](#fig_001a) A conceptual chart of the cognitive sciencestoday in the form of a polar map, with the contributing disciplines in theangular dimensions and different approaches in the radial axis. 

We begin in part II withthe center or core of cognitive science, known generally as cognitivism.[4](#4_3) The central tool and guidingmetaphor of cognitivism is the digital computer. A computer is a physicaldevice built in such a way that a particular set of its physical changes can beinterpreted as computations. A computation is an operation performed or carriedout on symbols, that is, on elements that representwhat they stand for. (For example, the symbol “7” represents the number 7.)Simplifying for the moment, we can say that cognitivism consists in thehypothesis that cognition—human cognition included—is the manipulation ofsymbols after the fashion of digital computers. In other words, cognition is mental representation: the mind is thought to operate bymanipulating symbols that represent features of the world or represent theworld as being a certain way. According to this cognitivist hypothesis, thestudy of cognition qua mental representation provides the proper domain ofcognitive science, a domain held to be independent of neurobiology at one endand sociology and anthropology at the other. 

Cognitivism has thevirtue of being a well-defined research program, complete with prestigiousinstitutions, journals, applied technology, and international commercialconcerns. We refer to it as the center or core of cognitive science because itdominates research to such an extent that it is often simply taken to becognitive science itself. In the past few years, however, several alternativeapproaches to cognition have appeared. These approaches diverge fromcognitivism along two basic lines of dissent: (1) a critique of symbolprocessing as the appropriate vehicle for representations, and (2) a critiqueof the adequacy of the notion of representation as the Archimedes point forcognitive science. 

The first alternative, which we call emergenceand explore more fully in part III, is typically referred to as connectionism.This name is derived from the idea that many cognitive tasks (such as visionand memory) seem to be handled best by systems made up of many simplecomponents, which, when connected by the appropriate rules, give rise to globalbehavior corresponding to the desired task. Symbolic processing, however, islocalized. Operations on symbols can be specified using only the physical formof the symbols, not their meaning. Of course, it is this feature of symbolsthat enables one to build a physical device to manipulate them. Thedisadvantage is that the loss of any part of the symbols or the rules for theirmanipulation results in a serious malfunction. Connectionist models generallytrade localized, symbolic processing for distributed operations (ones thatextend over an entire network of components) and so result in the emergence ofglobal properties resilient to local malfunction. For connectionists arepresentation consists in the correspondence between such an emergent globalstate and properties of the world; it is not a function of particular symbols. 

The second alternative,which we explore and defend in part IV, is born from a deeper dissatisfactionthan the connectionist search for alternatives to symbolic processing. Itquestions the centrality of the notion that cognition is fundamentallyrepresentation. Behind this notion stand three fundamental assumptions. Thefirst is that we inhabit a world with particular properties, such as length,color, movement, sound, etc. The second is that we pick up or recover theseproperties by internally representing them. The third is that there is aseparate subjective “we” who does these things. These three assumptions amountto a strong, often tacit and unquestioned, commitment to realism orobjectivism/subjectivism about the way the world is, what we are, and how wecome to know the world. 

Even the most hard-nosedbiologist, however, would have to admit that there are many ways that the worldis—indeed even many different worlds of experience—depending on the structureof the being involved and the kinds of distinctions it is able to make. Andeven if we restrict our attention to human cognition, there are many variousways the world can be taken to be.[5](#5_3)This nonobjectivist (and at best also nonsubjectivist) conviction is slowlygrowing in the study of cognition. As yet, however, this alternativeorientation does not have a well-established name, for it is more of anumbrella that covers a relatively small group of people working in diversefields. We propose as a name the term enactive toemphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of apregiven world by a pregiven mind but is rather the enactment of a world and amind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in theworld performs. The enactive approach takes seriously, then, the philosophicalcritique of the idea that the mind is a mirror of nature but goes further byaddressing this issue from within the heartland of science.[6](#6_3)

## Cognitive Science within the Circle 

We began this chapterwith a reflection on the fundamental circularity in scientific method thatwould be noted by a philosophically inclined cognitive scientist. From thestandpoint of enactive cognitive science, this circularity is central; it is anepistemological necessity. In contrast, the other, more extant forms ofcognitive science start from the view that cognition and mind are entirely dueto the particular structures of cognitive systems. The most obvious expressionof this view is found in neuroscience, where cognition is investigated bylooking at the properties of the brain. One can associate these biologicallybased properties with cognition only through behavior. It is only because thisstructure, the brain, undergoes interactions in an environment that we canlabel the ensuing behavior as cognitive. The basic assumption, then, is that toevery form of behavior and experience we can ascribe specific brain structures(however roughly). And, conversely, changes in brain structure manifestthemselves in behavioral and experiential alterations. We may diagram this viewas in [figure 1.2](#fig_002).(In this diagram and those that follow, the double arrows expressinterdependence or mutual specification.)

[Figure 1.5](#fig_005a) Interdependency of the background andembodiment. 

Yet upon reflection wecannot avoid as a matter of consistency the logical implication that by thissame view any such scientific description, either of biological or mentalphenomena, must itself be a product of the structure of our own cognitivesystem. We may diagram this further understanding as in [figure 1.3](#fig_003). 

Furthermore, the act ofreflection that tells us this does not come from nowhere; we find ourselvesperforming that act of reflection out of a given background (in theHeideggerian sense) of biological, social, and cultural beliefs and practices.[7](#7_3) We portray this further step as in[figure 1.4](#fig_004).

But then yet again, ourvery postulation of such a background is something that weare doing: we are here, living embodied beings,sitting and thinking of this entire scheme, including what we call abackground. So, in all rigor, we should caption our entire endeavor with yetanother layer indicating this embodiment here and now as in [figure 1.5](#fig_005). 

Plainly, this kind oflayering could go on indefinitely, as in an Escher drawing. This last movemakes it evident that, rather than adding layers of continued abstraction, we shouldgo back where we started, to the concreteness and particularity of our ownexperience—even in the endeavor of reflection. Thefundamental insight of the enactive approach as explored in this book is to beable to see our activities as reflections of a structure without losing sightof the directness of our own experience. 

 

## TheTheme of This Book 

This book is devoted tothe exploration of this deep circularity. We will endeavor throughout to keepin mind our theoretical constructs about structure without losing sight of theimmediacy of our experience. 

Some aspects of thebasic circularity of our condition have been discussed by philosophers invarious ways at least since Hegel. The contemporary philosopher Charles Taylorrefers to it when he says that we are “self-interpreting animals” and sowonders “whether features which are crucial to our self-understanding as agentscan be accorded no place in our explanatory theory.”[8](#8_2)The usual response on the part of cognitive scientists is well put by DanielDennett when he writes that “every cognitivist theory currently defended orenvisaged … is a theory of the sub-personal level. It is not at all clear tome, indeed, how a psychological theory—as distinct from a philosophicaltheory—could fail to be a sub-personal theory.”[9](#9_3)For Dennett, our self-understanding presupposes cognitive notions such asbelieving, desiring, and knowing but does not explain them. Therefore, if thestudy of mind is to be rigorous and scientific, it cannot be bound toexplanations in terms of features essential to our self-understanding. 

For the moment we wishsimply to emphasize the deep tension in our present world between science andexperience. In our present world science is so dominant that we give it theauthority to explain even when it denies what is most immediate and direct—oureveryday, immediate experience. Thus most people would hold as a fundamentaltruth the scientific account of matter/space as collections of atomicparticles, while treating what is given in their immediate experience, with allof its richness, as less profound and true. Yet when we relax into theimmediate bodily well-being of a sunny day or of the bodily tension ofanxiously running to catch a bus, such accounts of space/matter fade into thebackground as abstract and secondary. 

When it is cognition ormind that is being examined, the dismissal of experience becomes untenable,even paradoxical. The tension comes to the surface especially in cognitivescience because cognitive science stands at the crossroads where the naturalsciences and the human sciences meet. Cognitive science is thereforeJanus-faced, for it looks down both roads at once: One of its faces is turnedtoward nature and sees cognitive processes as behavior. The other is turnedtoward the human world (or what phenomenologists call the “life-world”) andsees cognition as experience. 

When we ignore thefundamental circularity of our situation, this double face of cognitive sciencegives rise to two extremes: we suppose either that our human self-understandingis simply false and hence will eventually be replaced by a mature cognitivescience, or we suppose that there can be no science of the human life-worldbecause science must always presuppose it. 

These two extremessummarize much of the general philosophical debate surrounding cognitivescience. At one end stand philosophers such as Stephen Stich and Paul andPatricia Churchland who argue that our self-understanding is simply false.[10](#10_3) (Note the Churchlands’ suggestionthat we might come to refer to brain states instead of experiences in actualdaily discourse.) At the other end stand philosophers such as Hubert Dreyfusand Charles Taylor who seriously doubt the very possibility of cognitivescience (perhaps because they often seem to accept the equation of cognitivescience with cognitivism).11 The debate thusrecapitulates—though with new twists—the typical oppositions within the humansciences. If, in the midst of this confusion, the fate of human experience hasbeen left to the philosophers, their lack of agreement does not bode well. 

Unless we move beyondthese oppositions, the rift between science and experience in our society willdeepen. Neither extreme is workable for a pluralistic society that must embraceboth science and the actuality of human experience. To deny the truth of ourown experience in the scientific study of ourselves is not only unsatisfactory;it is to render the scientific study of ourselves without a subject matter. Butto suppose that science cannot contribute to an understanding of our experiencemay be to abandon, within the modern context, the task of self-understanding.Experience and scientific understanding are like two legs without which wecannot walk. 

We can phrase this verysame idea in positive terms: it is only by having a sense of common groundbetween cognitive science and human experience that our understanding ofcognition can be more complete and reach a satisfying level. We thus propose aconstructive task: to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science to include thebroader panorama of human, lived experience in a disciplined, transformativeanalysis. As a constructive task, the search for this expansion becomesmotivated by scientific research itself, as we will see throughout this work.

# [2 ]()What Do We Mean “Human Experience”? 

## Scienceand the Phenomenological Tradition 

Our formulation in theprevious chapter obviously owes much to the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty. Weinvoke him because in our Western tradition he seems to be one of the few whosework was committed to an exploration of the fundamental entre-deux betweenscience and experience, experience and world. Another reason is thatMerleau-Ponty was committed to seeing this circularity from the vantage pointof what corresponded to cognitive science in his time—the emerging work inneuropsychology that was being pioneered in France. In his first major work, The Structure of Behavior,[1](#1_5)Merleau-Ponty argued for the mutual illumination among a phenomenology ofdirect lived experience, psychology, and neurophysiology. Clearly thiscomplementary style of work, the backbone of our concern in this book, was nottaken up much further. The scientific tradition moved west to a predominantlypositivist environment in the United States, and it is from there that themodem cognitive sciences familiar to us today were formed. We will come back tothese formative years of cognitive science in the next chapter. 

Throughout his writings,Merleau-Ponty drew on the earlier work of the German philosopher, EdmundHusserl. Husserl emphasized the importance of a direct examination ofexperience in a way that was radical, and yet deeply tied to the Western philosophicaltradition. Descartes had seen the mind as a subjective consciousness thatcontained ideas that corresponded (or sometimes failed to correspond) to whatwas in the world. This view of the mind as representing the world reached itsculmination in Franz Brentano’s notion of intentionality.According to Brentano, all mental states (perception, memory, etc.) are of or about something; in hiswords, mental states necessarily have “reference to a content” or “directiontoward an object” (which is not necessarily a thing in the world).[2](#2_5)This directedness or intentionality, Brentano claimed, was the definingcharacteristic of the mind. (This use of intentionalshould not be confused with its use to mean “doing something on purpose.”) 

Husserl was a student ofBrentano’s and extended his work. In one of his major works, Ideas: General Introduction to a Pure Phenomenology,[3](#3_5) published in 1913, Husserl tried todevelop a specific procedure for examining the structure of intentionality,which was the structure of experience itself, without any reference to thefactual, empirical world. He called this procedure “bracketing” (epoché), for it required that one put out of action, as ifin brackets, one’s ordinary judgments about the relation between experience andthe world. The standpoint from which these ordinary judgments are made Husserlcalled the “natural attitude”; it is the attitude generally known as “naive realism,”which consists in the conviction not only that the world is independent of mindor cognition but that things generally are the way they appear. By bracketingthe thesis of the natural attitude, Husserl claimed to be able to study theintentional contents of the mind purely internally, that is, without tracingthem back to what they seemed to refer to in the world. By this procedure heclaimed to have discovered a new domain that was prior to any empiricalscience. In Ideas, Husserl set out to explore thisnew domain by reflecting purely upon consciousness and discerning its essentialstructures. In a sort of philosophicalintrospection—which he called the “intuition of essences” (Wesenschau)—Husserltried to reduce experience to these essential structures and then show how ourhuman world was generated from them. 

Husserl thus took thefirst step of the reflective scientist: he claimed that to understandcognition, we cannot take the world naively but must see it instead as havingthe mark of our own structure. He also took the second step, at leastpartially, in realizing that that structure (the first step) was something thathe was cognizing with his own mind. In the philosophical fashion of his Westerntradition, however, he did not take the further steps we discussed in chapter1. He began with a solitary individual consciousness, took the structure he wasseeking to be entirely mental and accessible to consciousness in an act ofabstract philosophical introspection, and from there had great difficulty ingenerating the consensual, intersubjective world of human experience.[4](#4_5) And having no method other thanhis own philosophical introspection, he certainly could not take the final movewhich would return him to his experience, back to the beginning of the process.The irony of Husserl’s procedure, then, is that although he claimed to beturning philosophy toward a direct facing of experience, he was actuallyignoring both the consensual aspect and the direct embodied aspect ofexperience. (In this Husserl followed Descartes: he called his phenomenology atwentieth-century Cartesianism.) It is not surprising, therefore, that youngerEuropean philosophers turned increasingly away from pure phenomenology toembrace existentialism. 

Husserl recognized someof these problems in his later work. In his last work, TheCrisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology,[5](#5_5) he once more took up the task ofarticulating the basis and method of phenomenological reflection. Here,however, he explicitly focused on the experience of consciousness in what hecalled the “lived-world.” The lived world is not the naive, theoreticalconception of the world found in the natural attitude. It is, rather, theeveryday social world, in which theory is always directed toward some practicalend.[6](#6_5) Husserl argued that allreflection, all theoretical activity, including science, presupposes thelife-world as a background. The task of the phenomenologist now became theanalysis of the essential relation betweenconsciousness, experience, and this life-world. 

For Husserl, thisanalysis had to be undertaken for an additional reason: the role of thelife-world had become obscured by the dominance of the objectivist conceptionof science. Husserl referred to this view as the “Galilean style” in science,for it consists in taking the idealized formulations of mathematical physics asdescriptions of the way the world really is independent of the knowing subject.He disputed the equation of science in general with this specific style. Buthis argument was not directed against the scientific description of the worldper se. Indeed, he wished to revitalize the natural sciences against what heperceived to be the rising tide of irrationalism in philosophy (which he tookto be symptomatic of the “crisis” of European life in general). It was theequation of the Galilean style with all of science that obscured the relationbetween science and the life-world and so made impossible any philosophicalgrounding of the claims of the empirical sciences. 

The solution to theproblem, Husserl thought, was to expand the notion of science to include a newscience of the life-world—pure phenomenology—which would link science andexperience without succumbing to the objectivism of the Galilean style on theone hand and the irrationalism of existentialism on the other. 

## The Breakdown of Phenomenology 

Even in The Crisis, Husserl insisted that phenomenology is thestudy of essences. Thus the analysis of the life-world that he undertook therewas not anthropological or historical; it was philosophical. But if alltheoretical activity presupposes the life-world, what, then, of phenomenology?It is a distinctly theoretical pursuit; indeed, Husserl claimed it is the veryhighest form of theory. But then phenomenology too must presuppose thelife-world, even as it attempts to explicate it. Thus Husserl was being hauntedby the untraversed steps of the fundamental circularity. 

Husserl recognized someof this circularity and tried to deal with it in an interesting way. He arguedthat the life-world was really a set of sedimented, background preunderstandings or (roughly speaking) assumptions, whichthe phenomenologist could make explicit and treat as a system of beliefs. Inother words, Husserl tried to break out of the circle by treating thebackground as consisting essentially of representations.[7](#7_5)Once the life-world is construed in this way, however, Husserl’s claim (indeed,the central claim of phenomenology) that the life-world is always prior toscience becomes unstable. If the background consists of representations, whatis to prevent scientific knowledge from permeating the background andcontributing to its tacit store of beliefs? And if such permeation is possible,then what happens to the priority of phenomenology? 

Husserl must haverecognized these problems because he argued both that the life-world is priorto science and that our Western tradition is unique because our life-world ispermeated by science. The task of the phenomenologist was to move back from ananalysis of our scientifically permeated life-world to the “original” or“pregiven” life-world. But Husserl held on to the idea that this originallife-world could be exhaustively accounted for by tracing it back to theessential structures of consciousness. He thus embraced the peculiar thoughtthat the phenomenologist could stand both inside and outside of the life-world:he stood inside because all theory presupposed the life-world, and yet he stoodoutside because phenomenology alone could trace the genesis of the life-worldin consciousness. Indeed, phenomenology was the highest form of theory forHusserl precisely because it was capable of such a peculiar contortion.[8](#8_4) 

Given this peculiarcontortion, it is not surprising that Husserl’s pure phenomenology was not (ashe hoped it would be) cultivated and improved on from one generation to thenext, unlike other methodological discoveries such as the methods forstatistical inference. Indeed, it has been the headache of later commentatorsto find out just exactly how his method of “phenomenological reduction” is toproceed. 

But there is a deeperreason for the failure of the Husserlian project that we wish to emphasizehere: Husserl’s turn toward experience and “the things themselves” was entirelytheoretical, or, to make the point the other wayaround, it completely lacked any pragmatic dimension.It is hardly surprising, therefore, that it could not overcome the rift betweenscience and experience, for science, unlike phenomenological reflection, has alife beyond theory. Thus although Husserl’s turn toward a phenomenologicalanalysis of experience seemed radical, it was, in fact, quite within themainstream of Western philosophy. 

Indeed, this criticismwould hold even for Heidegger’s existential phenomenology, as well as forMerleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of lived experience. Both stressed the pragmatic,embodied context of human experience, but in a purely theoretical way. Despitethe fact that one of Heidegger’s chief arguments against Husserl was theimpossibility of separating lived experience from the consensual background ofcultural beliefs and practices, despite the fact that in a Heideggeriananalysis one cannot, strictly speaking, speak of ahuman mind at all apart from that background, still Heidegger consideredphenomenology the true method of ontology, a theoretical inquiry into humanexistence (Dasein) that was logically prior to anyform of scientific investigation. Merleau-Ponty took Heidegger one step furtherby applying Heidegger’s own criticism to phenomenology itself as well as toscience. In Merleau-Ponty’s view, both science and phenomenology explicated ourconcrete, embodied existence in a manner that was always after the fact. Itattempted to grasp the immediacy of our unreflective experience and tried togive voice to it in conscious reflection. But precisely by being a theoreticalactivity after the fact, it could not recapture the richness of experience; itcould be only a discourse about that experience. Merleau-Ponty admitted this inhis own way by saying that his task was infinite.[9](#9_5)

Within our Westerntradition, phenomenology was and still is thephilosophy of human experience, the only extant edifice of thought thataddresses these issues head-on. But above all, it was and still is philosophyas theoretical reflection. In most of the Western tradition since the Greeks,philosophy has been the discipline that seeks to find the truth, including thetruth about the mind, purely by means of abstract, theoretical reasoning. Evenphilosophers who critique or problematize reason do so only by means ofarguments, demonstrations, and—especially in our so-called postmodernera—linguistic exhibitions (i.e., by means of abstract thought).Merleau-Ponty’s critique of science and phenomenology, that they are theoreticalactivities after the fact, can equally be applied to most of Western philosophyas theoretical reflection. In this way, the loss of faith in reason so rampantin current thought becomes simultaneously a loss of faith in philosophy. 

But if we turn away fromreason, if reason is no longer taken as the method for knowing the mind, whatcan be used instead? One alternative is unreason,and, in the form of psychoanalytic theory, it has probably come to have moreinfluence on our Western folk conception of the mind than any other singlecultural factor. People—certainly middle-class North Americans andEuropeans—have come to believe that they have an unconscious that isdevelopmentally and symbolically primitive. They believe that both dreams andmuch of their waking life—motives, fantasies, preferences, aversions, emotions,behaviors, and pathological symptoms—are explainable by means of thisunconscious. Thus, in the folk view, to know the mind “from the inside” is touse some version of psychoanalytic method to delve into the unconscious. 

This “folkpsychoanalytic” view is subject to the same critique that Merleau-Ponty made ofscience and phenomenology. The psychoanalytic method works within anindividual’s conceptual system. Whether an individual is commenting on a freeassociation or using mathematical logic, having an ordinary waking conversationor dealing with the highly convoluted symbolic language of dreams, that personis knowing the mind and commenting on it in an after-the-fact fashion. The “professional”psychoanalyst knows, however, that he has to work within an individual’sconceptual system and that a method that no theory can substitute for isrequired to go beyond this stage. What we find particularly interesting aboutpsychoanalysis is that despite its great differences from cognitivescience—despite the fact that it deals with phenomena of mind that are quitedifferent from the normal subject matter of cognitive science and studies themby patently different methods—we see some of the same stages of evolution thatwe identify in cognitive science mirrored in psychoanalytic theory. We shallpoint to the convergences in future chapters. We hasten to add that suchpointing will only be in the spirit of providing place markers, as it were, notcarefully constructed bridges, since we do not have firsthand experiences in apsychoanalytic process. 

We are still in need ofa method, however. Where can we turn for a tradition that can provide anexamination of human experience in both its reflective and its immediate, livedaspects? 

## A Non-Western Philosophical Tradition 

At this point, a boldstep needs to be taken, one that takes us to the heart of what we have topresent: we need to enlarge our horizon to encompass non-Western traditions ofreflection upon experience. If philosophy in the West no longer occupies aprivileged, foundational position with respect to other cultural activitiessuch as science or art, then a full appreciation of philosophy and itsimportance for human experience requires that we examine the role of philosophyin cultures other than our own. In our culture, cognitive science has causedgreat excitement among philosophers (and the public at large) because it hasenabled them to see their tradition in a new light. Were we to entertain theidea that there is no hard-and-fast distinction between science and philosophy,then philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, and Husserlwould take on a new significance: they could be seen, among other things, asprotocognitive scientists. (Or as Jerry Fodor puts it, “In intellectualhistory, everything happens twice, first as philosophy and then as cognitivescience.”[10](#10_5)) Might this not also be the casefor philosophical traditions with which we are less familiar? 

In this book we willfocus on one such tradition, that which derives from the Buddhist method ofexamining experience called mindfulness meditation.We believe that the Buddhist doctrines of no-self and of nondualism that grewout of this method have a significant contribution to make in a dialogue withcognitive science: (1) The no-self doctrine contributes to understanding thefragmentation of self portrayed in cognitivism and connectionism. (2) Buddhistnondualism, particularly as it is presented in the Madhyamaka (which literallymeans “middle way”) philosophy of Nagarjuna, may be juxtaposed with theentre-deux of Merleau-Ponty and with the more recent ideas of cognition asenaction.[11](#11_2) 

It is our contentionthat the rediscovery of Asian philosophy, particularly of the Buddhisttradition, is a second renaissance in the cultural history of the West, withthe potential to be equally important as the rediscovery of Greek thought inthe European renaissance. Our Western histories of philosophy, which ignoreIndian thought, are artificial, since India and Greece share with us anIndo-European linguistic heritage as well as many cultural and philosophicalpreoccupations.[12](#12_1) 

There is, however, amore important reason for our interest. In the Indian tradition, philosophynever became a purely abstract occupation. It was tied (“yoked,” as istraditionally said) to specific disciplined methods for knowing—differentmethods of meditation. In particular, within the Buddhist tradition, the methodof mindfulness was considered fundamental. Mindfulness means that the mind ispresent in embodied everyday experience; mindfulness techniques are designed tolead the mind back from its theories and preoccupations, back from the abstractattitude, to the situation of one’s experience itself.[13](#13_1)Furthermore, and equally of interest in the modern context, the descriptionsand commentaries on mind that grew out of this tradition never became divorcedfrom living pragmatics: they were intended to inform an individual as to how tohandle his mind in personal and interpersonal situations, and they bothinformed and became embodied in the structure of communities. 

We are currently, in theWest, in an ideal position to study Buddhism in its fully embodied aspects.First, the current trend for global integration and the growing impact ofnon-Western traditions have made it possible to appreciate that the designationand delineation of “religion” in the West is itself a cultural artifact thatmay, if taken literally, seriously hamper our understanding of othertraditions. Second, in the last two decades Buddhism has actually taken root inWestern countries and has begun to flourish as a living tradition. We have ahistorically unique situation in which the many culturally diverse forms thatBuddhism assumed have been transplanted to the same geographical locations andare interacting with each other and with their host cultures. For example, insome of the large cities of North America and Europe,within walking distance of each other one might find centers representing allof the major forms of Buddhism in the world—the Theravadin traditions ofSoutheast Asia, the Mahayana forms from Vietnam, China, Korea, and Japan, andthe Vajrayana of Japan and Tibet. Whereas some centers represent religiousinstitutions of a particular ethnic immigrant population, many are composed ofWesterners who, under the guidance of traditionally sanctioned teachers, arepracticing and studying the form of Buddhism with which they are connected andare experimenting with how their particular teachings are to be acted outindividually and communally in the sociocultural context of the modern Westernworld. 

These factors are agreat boon to the contemporary study of Buddhism, whether by interestedindividuals, scholars, or by the social and cognitive sciences. Unlike theinitial introduction of Greek thought during the Renaissance, we are notdependent for our knowledge of Buddhist practices and ideas on theinterpretation of a few fragmentary, historical, hermeneutically isolatedtexts—we can observe what texts are actually taught, how they are interpretedand used, and how, in general, the meditations, practices, and explicitteachings of Buddhism are being transmitted within the living practices ofthese developing Buddhist communities. We will rely not only on scholarship butalso on these indigenous teachings in the presentations that follow.[14](#14_1) 

## ExaminingExperience with a Method: Mindfulness/Awareness 

There are many humanactivities of body and mind, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. The word meditation in its general usage in modern America has anumber of different prominent folk meanings:[15](#15_1)(1) a state of concentration in which consciousness is focused on only oneobject; (2) a state of relaxation that is psychologically and medicallybeneficial; (3) a dissociated state in which trance phenomena can occur; and(4) a mystical state in which higher realities or religious objects areexperienced. These are all altered states of consciousness; the meditator isdoing something to get away from his usual mundane, unconcentrated, unrelaxed,nondissociated, lower state of reality. 

Buddhistmindfulness/awareness practice is intended to be just the opposite of these.Its purpose is to become mindful, to experience what one’s mind is doing as itdoes it, to be present with one’s mind. What relevance does this have forcognitive science? We believe that if cognitive science is to include humanexperience, it must have some method for exploring and knowing what humanexperience is. It is for this reason that we are focusing on the Buddhisttradition of mindfulness meditation. 

To get a sense of whatmindfulness meditation is, one must first realize the extent to which peopleare normally not mindful. Usually one notices the tendency of the mind towander only when one is attempting to accomplish some mental task and thewandering interferes. Or perhaps one realizes that one has just finished ananticipated pleasurable activity without noticing it. In fact, body and mindare seldom closely coordinated. In the Buddhist sense, we are not present. 

How can this mind becomean instrument for knowing itself? How can the flightiness, the nonpresence ofmind be worked with? Traditionally, texts talk about two stages of practice:calming or taming the mind (Sanscrit: shamatha) andthe development of insight (Sanscrit: vipashyana).[16](#16_1) Shamatha, when used as a separatepractice, is in fact a concentration technique for learning to hold (“tether”is the traditional term) the mind to a single object. Such concentration couldeventually lead to states of blissful absorption; although such states wereassiduously cataloged within Buddhist psychology, they were not generallyrecommended. The purpose of calming the mind in Buddhism is not to becomeabsorbed but to render the mind able to be present with itself long enough togain insight into its own nature and functioning. (There are many traditionalanalogies for this process. For example, to be able to see paintings on thewall of a dark cave, one needs a good light protected from thewind.) Most present-day schools of Buddhism do not practice shamatha andvipashyana as separate techniques but rather combine the functions of calmingand of insight into a single meditation technique. (Some of the terminologicalconfusions that result are, we hope, clarified in appendix A). We will referhere to these types of meditation by their more experiential designations asmindfulness/awareness meditation. 

The description ofmindfulness/awareness meditation that follows is based on the writings and oralpresentations of traditional teachers and on observations, interviews, anddiscussions with present-day students of Buddhism from the major Buddhisttraditions. Typically mindfulness/awareness is trained by means of formalperiods of sitting meditation. The purpose of such periods is to simplify thesituation to the bare minimum. The body is put into an upright posture and heldstill. Some simple object, often the breath, is used as the focus of alertattention. Each time the meditator realizes that his mind is wanderingunmindfully, he is to acknowledge nonjudgmentally that wandering (there arevarious instructions as to how this is to be done) and bring the mind back toits object. 

Breathing is one of themost simple, basic, ever-present bodily activities. Yet beginning meditatorsare generally astonished at how difficult it is to be mindful of even souncomplex an object. Meditators discover that mind and body are notcoordinated. The body is sitting, but the mind is seized constantly bythoughts, feelings, inner conversations, daydreams, fantasies, sleepiness,opinions, theories, judgments about thoughts and feelings, judgments aboutjudgments—a never-ending torrent of disconnected mental events that themeditators do not even realize are occurring except at those brief instantswhen they remember what they are doing. Even when they attempt to return totheir object of mindfulness, the breath, they may discover that they are onlythinking about the breath rather than being mindful of the breath. 

Eventually, it begins todawn on the meditators that there is an actual difference between being presentand not being present. In daily life they also begin to have instants of wakingup to the realization that they are not present and of flashing back for amoment to be present—not to the breath, in this case, but to whatever is goingon. Thus the first great discovery of mindfulness meditation tends to be notsome encompassing insight into the nature of mind but the piercing realizationof just how disconnected humans normally are from their very experience. Eventhe simplest or most pleasurable of daily activities—walking, eating,conversing, driving, reading, waiting, thinking, making love, planning,gardening, drinking, remembering, going to a therapist, writing, dozing,emoting, sightseeing—all pass rapidly in a blur of abstact commentary as themind hastens to its next mental occupation. The meditator now discovers thatthe abstract attitude which Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty ascribe to science andphilosophy is actually the attitude of everyday life when one is not mindful.This abstract attitude is the spacesuit, the padding of habits andpreconceptions, the armor with which one habitually distances oneself fromone’s experience. 

From the point of viewof mindfulness/awareness meditation, humans are not trapped forever in theabstract attitude. The dissociation of mind from body, of awareness fromexperience, is the result of habit, and these habits can be broken. As themeditator again and again interrupts the flow of discursive thought and returnsto be present with his breath or daily activity, there is a gradual taming ofthe mind’s restlessness. One begins to be able to see the restlessness as suchand to become patient with it, rather than becoming automatically lost in it.[17](#17_1) Eventually meditators reportperiods of a more panoramic perspective. This is called awareness. At thispoint the breath is no longer needed as a focus. In one traditional analogy,mindfulness is likened to the individual words of a sentence, whereas awarenessis the grammar that encompasses the entire sentence. Meditators also reportexperiencing space and spaciousness of mind. A traditional metaphor for thisexperience is that mind is the sky (a nonconceptual background) in whichdifferent mental contents, like clouds, arise and subside. Experience ofpanoramic awareness and of space are natural outgrowths ofmindfulness/awareness meditation, since they begin to occur in meditators notonly in Buddhist traditions where they have doctrinal significance and wherethey are thus encouraged but also in those traditions where they are discouraged (some Theravadin schools) and where specificantidotes to them then need to be applied. In those traditions, the developmentof practice is focused on increased intensity of mindfulness. 

How is it thatmindfulness/awareness can develop? There are two traditional approaches totalking about this. In one, the development is treated as the training of goodhabits. The mental fact of mindfulness is being strengthened like the trainingof a muscle that can then perform harder and longer work without tiring. In theother approach, mindfulness/awareness is considered part of the basic nature ofthe mind; it is the natural state of mind that has been temporarily obscured byhabitual patterns of grasping and delusion. The untamed mind constantly triesto grasp some stable point in its unending movement and to cling to thoughts,feelings, and concepts as if they were a solid ground. As all these habits arecut through and one learns an attitude of letting go, the mind’s naturalcharacteristic of knowing itself and reflecting its own experience can shineforth. This is the beginning of wisdom or maturity (prajña).

It is important torealize that such maturity does not mean assuming the abstract attitude. AsBuddhist teachers often point out, knowledge, in the sense of prajña, is notknowledge about anything. There is no abstract knowerof an experience that is separate from the experience itself. Buddhist teachersoften talk of becoming one with one’s experience. What, then, are the contentsor discoveries of this wisdom? 

## TheRole of Reflection in the Analysis of Experience 

If the results ofmindfulness/awareness practice are to bring one closer to one’s ordinaryexperience rather than further from it, what can be the role of reflection? Oneof our popular cultural images of Buddhism is that the intellect is destroyed.In fact, study and contemplation play a major role in all Buddhist schools. Thespontaneous action, much dramatized in the popular image of the Zen master, isnot contradictory to the use of reflection as a mode of learning. How can thisbe? 

This question brings usto the methodological heart of the interaction between mindfulness/awarenessmeditation, phenomenology, and cognitive science. What we are suggesting is achange in the nature of reflection from an abstract, disembodied activity to anembodied (mindful), open-ended reflection. By embodied,we mean reflection in which body and mind have been brought together. What thisformulation intends to convey is that reflection is not just on experience, but reflection isa form of experience itself—and that reflective form of experience can beperformed with mindfulness/awareness. When reflection is done in that way, itcan cut the chain of habitual thought patterns and preconceptions such that itcan be an open-ended reflection, open to possibilities other than thosecontained in one’s current representations of the life space. We call this formof reflection mindful, open-ended reflection. 

In our usual trainingand practice as Western scientists and philosophers, we obviously proceeddifferently. We ask, “What is mind?,” “What is body?” and proceed to reflecttheoretically and to investigate scientifically. This procedure gives rise to agamut of claims, experiments, and results on various facets of cognitiveabilities. But in the course of these investigations we often forget just whois asking this question and how it is asked. By not including ourselves in thereflection, we pursue only a partial reflection, and our question becomesdisembodied; it attempts to express, in the words of the philosopher ThomasNagel, a “view from nowhere.”[18](#18_1) It is ironic that it is just thisattempt to have a disembodied view from nowhere that leads to having a viewfrom a very specific, theoretically confined, preconceptually entrappedsomewhere. 

The phenomenologicaltradition, from Husserl on, complained bitterly about this lack of self-included reflection but was able to offer in itsplace only a project of theoretical reflection onexperience. The other extreme is to include the self but abandon reflectionaltogether in favor of a naive, subjective impulsivity. Mindfulness/awarenessis neither of these; it works directly with, and so expresses, our basicembodiment. 

Let us see how thedifference in the theoretical and the mindfulness traditions of reflection manifestin an actual issue—the so-called mind-body problem. From Descartes on, theguiding question in Western philosophy has been whether body and mind are oneor two distinct substances (properties, levels of description, etc.) and whatthe ontological relation between them is. We have already seen the simple,experiential, pragmatic approach taken in mindfulness/awareness meditation. Itis a matter of simple experience that our mind and body can be dissociated,that the mind can wander, that we can be unaware of where we are and what ourbody or mind are doing.[19](#19_1) But this situation, this habit ofmindlessness, can be changed. Body and mind can be brought together. We candevelop habits in which body and mind are fully coordinated. The result is amastery that is not only known to the individual meditator himself but that isvisible to others—we easily recognize by its precision and grace a gesture thatis animated by full awareness. We typically associate such mindfulness with theactions of an expert such as an athlete or musician. 

We are suggesting thatDescartes’s conclusion that he was a thinking thing was the product of hisquestion, and that question was a product of specific practices—those of disembodied,unmindful reflection. Husserlian phenomenology, though it embraced experiencein a radical way, nonetheless continued the tradition by reflecting only uponthe essential structures of thought. And even though it has recently becomequite fashionable to criticize or “deconstruct” this standpoint of the cogito, philosophers still do not depart from the basic practice responsible for it. 

Theoretical reflectionneed not be mindless and disembodied. The basic assertion of this progressiveapproach to human experience is that the mind-body relation or modality is notsimply fixed and given but can be fundamentally changed. Many people wouldacknowledge the obvious truth of this conviction. Western philosophy does notdeny this truth so much as ignore it. 

To expand this point: Asis the case with mindfulness in general, there are two ways of talking aboutthe development of embodied reflection. One way—a preliminary or beginner’sapproach—is to liken it to the development of a skill. Take learning to play aflute. The description goes thus: One is shown the basic positions of thefingers, perhaps directly or in the form of a fingering chart. One thenpractices these notes in various combinations over and over until a basic skillis acquired. In the beginning, the relation between mental intention and bodilyact is quite undeveloped—mentally one knows what to do, but one is physicallyunable to do it. As one practices, the connection between intention and actbecomes closer, until eventually the feeling of difference between them isalmost entirely gone. One achieves a certain condition that phenomenologicallyfeels neither purely mental nor purely physical; it is, rather, a specific kindof mind-body unity. And, of course, there are many levels of possible interpretation,as can be seen in the variety of accomplished performers. 

Although such examplesmay seem compelling and although meditation instructions for beginnerssometimes make mindfulness sound like the development of a skill, descriptionof the process only in these terms can actually be quite misleading.Contemplative traditions from around the world agree that if one thinks thepoint of meditative practice is to develop special skills and make oneself intoa religious, philosophical, or meditative virtuoso, then one is engaging inself-deception and is actually going in the opposite direction. In particular,the practices involved in the development of mindfulness/awareness arevirtually never described as the training of meditative virtuosity (andcertainly not as the development of a higher, more evolved spirituality)[20](#20_1) but rather as the letting go ofhabits of mindlessness, as an unlearning rather thana learning. This unlearning may take training and effort, but it is a differentsense of effort from the acquiring of something new. It is precisely when themeditator approaches the development of mindfulness with the greatestambitions—the ambition to acquire a new skill throughdetermination and effort—that his mind fixates and races, andmindfulness/awareness is most elusive. This is why the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation talks about effortless efforts and why it usesthe analogy for meditation of tuning, rather than playing, a stringedinstrument—the instrument must be tuned neither too tightly nor too loosely.When the mindfulness meditator finally begins to let go rather than to struggleto achieve some particular state of activity, then body and mind are found tobe naturally coordinated and embodied. Mindful reflection is then found to be acompletely natural activity. The importance of the distinction between skilland letting go should become increasingly apparent as we continue our story. 

In summary it is becausereflection in our culture has been severed from its bodily life that themind-body problem has become a central topic for abstract reflection. Cartesiandualism is not so much one competing solution as it is the formulation of thisproblem. Reflection is taken to be distinctively mental, and so the problemarises of how it could ever be linked to bodily life. Although contemporarydiscussions of this problem have become quite sophisticated—largely because ofthe development of cognitive science—they have nevertheless not departed fromthe essentially Cartesian problematic of trying to understand how two seeminglydistinct things are related.[21](#21_1) (Whether these things aresubstances, properties, or merely levels of description rarely makes adifference to the basic structure of the discussion.) 

From the standpoint of amindful, open-ended reflection the mind-body question need not be, What is theontological relation between body and mind, regardless of anyone’sexperience?—but rather, What are the relations of body and mind in actualexperience (the mindfulness aspect), and how do these relations develop, whatforms can they take (the open-ended aspect)? As the Japanese philosopher YasuoYuasa remarks, “One starts from the experiential assumption that the mind-bodymodality changes through the training of the mind and body by means ofcultivation (shugyo) or training (keiko).Only after assuming this experiential ground does one ask what the mind-bodyrelation is. That is, the mind-body issue is not simply a theoreticalspeculation but it is originally a practical, lived experience (taiken), involving the mustering of one’s whole mind andbody. The theoretical is only a reflection on this lived experience.”[22](#22_1) 

We may notice that thisviewpoint is resonant with pragmatism, a view in philosophy that is having amodern revival.[23](#23_1) The body and mind relation isknown in terms of what it can do. When one takes the more abstract attitude inphilosophy or science, one might think that questions about the body-mindrelation can be answered only after one first satisfactorily determines what isbody and what is mind in isolation and abstraction. In the pragmatic,open-ended reflection, however, these questions are not separate from “themustering of one’s whole mind and body.” Such involvement prevents thequestion, What is mind? from becoming disembodied. When we include in ourreflection on a question the asker of the question and the process of askingitself (recall the fundamental circularity), then the question receives a newlife and meaning. 

Perhaps the closestdiscipline familiar to Westerners that verges on a pragmatic, open-ended viewtoward knowledge is psychoanalysis. We have in mind not so much the content ofpsychoanalytic theory but rather the idea that the very conception of mind andof the subject who is undergoing analysis is understood to change as the web ofrepresentations in which the self is entangled is slowly penetrated throughanalysis. What we believe traditional psychoanalytic methods lack, however, isthe mindfulness/awareness component of reflection. 

## Experimentation and Experiential Analysis 

The form most closelyallied to pragmatism in science is the experimental method. If one wants toknow how many teeth a horse has, one counts the teeth. More elaboratehypotheses are theoretically reduced to possible observations by means ofdeductive inferences. Although the philosophical theory of such experimentationhas been historically tied to an objectivist, disembodied view of knowledge, itneed not be. 

Canmindfulness/awareness meditation be considered a kind of experimentation thatmakes discoveries about the nature and behavior of mind—a kind ofexperimentation that is embodied and open-ended? As we have already mentioned,in mindfulness/awareness meditation one does not begin by trying to attain somespecific state (as in concentrations, relaxations, trances, or mysticallyoriented practices); rather, the goal is to be mindful of the mind as it takesits own course. By letting go of the mind in this way, the natural activity ofthe mind to be alert and observant becomes apparent. 

Buddhist doctrines layclaim to being simply the observations that mind makes when it is allowed to benaturally observant. Indeed, all of the Buddhist assertions (lack of self, thecodependent arising of experience, and so on) are treated by Buddhist teachersas discoveries rather than creeds or doctrines. Buddhist teachers are fond ofpointing out that students are always invited, indeed required, to doubt suchassertions and to test them directly in their own experience rather than toaccept them as beliefs. (Of course if they come up with a drastically deviantanswer, they might be invited to look again—much as it happens with scientificteaching in its normal form.) 

There are two objectionsthat could be raised to the claim that mindfulness/awareness is a means ofdiscovery about the nature of experience. In the first place, one might wonderabout the relationship between knowledge gained by means of meditation and theactivity that we call introspection. After all, introspectionism as a school ofpsychology, made popular by the nineteenth-century psychologist Wilhelm Wundt,failed definitively to provide a basis for experimental psychology. There wasno agreement at all among different laboratories of introspection on whatresults were yielded by the introspectionist method—the very antithesis ofscience. But what was this method called introspection? Each laboratory beganwith a theory that experience was decomposable into certain kinds of elements,and subjects were trained to decompose their experience in that fashion. Asubject was asked to look at his own experience as an outside observer would.This is, in fact, what we usually think of as introspection in daily life. Thisis the very essence of what Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger called the abstractattitude of the scientist and the philosopher. The mindfulness meditator wouldsay that the introspectionists were not actually aware of mind at all; theywere just thinking about their thoughts. Such an activity would, of course,serve only to display whatever preconceptions one is holding about the mind—nowonder different laboratories disagreed with one another. It is precisely tocut through the attitude of introspection that mindfulness/awareness meditationexists. 

The second objectionthat could be raised to mindfulness/awareness as a method of observation of themind in situ is that by meditating or becoming mindful and aware, one isdisrupting one’s normal mode of being in the world, one’s active involvementand one’s taken for granted sense of the world’s independent reality. How canmindfulness, then, give us any information about that normal mode of being thatit disrupts? Our answer is that this question, to have meaning, must itselfpresuppose the abstract attitude; one is reflecting back upon the active involvementand saying it is or is not disrupted as though this could be perceived fromsome independent, abstract vantage point of knowledge. From the Buddhistperspective, it is only by means of natural mindfulness that Heidegger andMerleau-Ponty could ever have known about a normal mode of active involvementin the world in the first place. (Merleau-Pontyvirtually says as much himself in his preface to Phenomenologyof Perception.) What mindfulness disrupts is mindlessness—that is, beingmindlessly involved without realizing that that is what one is doing. It isonly in this sense that the observation changes what is being observed, andthat is part of what we mean by open-ended reflection. 

In conclusion, we haveargued that it is necessary to have a disciplined perspective on humanexperience that can enlarge the domain of cognitive science to include directexperience. We suggest such a perspective already exists in the form ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. Mindfulness/awareness practice, phenomenologicalphilosophy, and science are human activities; each is an expression of ourhuman embodiment. Naturally, Buddhist doctrine, Western phenomenology, andscience are each heir to numerous doctrinal disputes and conflicting claims.Each, however, insofar as it is a form of experimentation, is open to everyoneand may be examined with the methods of each of the others. Thus, we believethat mindfulness/awareness meditation can provide a natural bridge betweencognitive science and human experience. Particularly impressive to us is theconvergence that we have discovered among some of the main themes of Buddhistdoctrine, phenomenology, and cognitive science—themes concerning the self andthe relation between subject and object. It is to these themes that we now turnin our journey of discovery.

[13.](#13) The word mindfulness hasrecently been used in a non-Buddhist and nonmeditative sense by the psychologistEllen Langer in her book Mindfulness. The basicBuddhist meaning of mindfulness is simply to be present with one’s experience.Langer uses the word to refer to the human ability to be thoughtful, ratherthan automatic, about one’s experience and actions, and to be cognizant ofalternative modes of construal of situations. From the Buddhist point of view,what Langer is describing is not mindfulness but rather, perhaps, being in the“human realm.” It is only in human states of mind thatone can reflect on one’s experience and consider alternatives. Other states ofmind, such as intense aggression (hell realm) or stupidity (animal realm) aretoo habitually automatic to allow reflection. But just because one is in thehuman realm doesn’t mean that one is actually mindful in the Buddhist sense ofbeing present.

[II ]()Varieties ofCognitivism 

# [3 ]()Symbols: The Cognitivist Hypothesis 

## The Foundational Cloud 

Our exploration ofcognitive science and human experience begins in this chapter with anexamination of cognitivism—the center of our diagram in chapter 1—and itshistorical origins in the earlier, cybernetic era of cognitive science. Themain idea to be presented in part II is that the analysis of mind undertaken bycertain traditions of mindfulness/awareness provides a natural counterpart topresent-day cognitivist conceptions of mind. This chapter presents thecognitivist perspective; in the next chapter we will discuss some conclusions,in some respects similar, reached by means of mindfulness/awareness. 

Let us begin by lookingat the historical roots of present-day cognitivism. This short historicalexcursion is necessary, for a science that neglects its past is bound to repeatits mistakes and will be unable to visualize its development. Our excursionhere is, of course, not intended to be a comprehensive history but only totouch on those issues of direct relevance for our concerns here.[1](#1_7)

In fact, virtually allof the themes in present-day debates were already introduced in the formativeyears of cognitive science from 1943 to 1953. History indicates, then, thatthese themes are deep and hard to pursue. The “founding fathers” knew very wellthat their concerns amounted to a new science, and they christened this sciencewith the new name cybernetics. This name is no longerin current use, and many cognitive scientists today would not even recognizethe family connections. This lack of recognition is not idle. It reflects thefact that to become established as a science in its clear-cut cognitivistorientation, the future cognitive science had to sever itself from its roots,which were complex and entangled but also rich with possibilities for growth anddevelopment. Such a severance is often the case in the history of science: itis the price of passing from an exploratory stage to a full-fledged researchprogram—from a cloud to a crystal. 

The cybernetics phase ofcognitive science produced an amazing array of concrete results, in addition toits long-term (often underground) influence: 

·     The use of mathematical logic tounderstand the operation of the nervous system 

·     The invention ofinformation-processing machines (such as digital computers), thereby laying thebasis for artificial intelligence 

·     The establishment of themetadiscipline of systems theory, which has had an imprint in many branches ofscience, such as engineering (systems analysis, control theory), biology(regulatory physiology, ecology), social sciences (family therapy, structuralanthropology, management, urban studies), and economics (game theory) 

·     Information theory as astatistical theory of signal and communication channels 

·     The first examples ofself-organizing systems 

This list is impressive:we tend to consider many of these notions and tools an integral part of our lives. Yet they were all nonexistent before thisformative decade, and they were all produced by an intense exchange amongpeople of widely different backgrounds. Thus the work during this era was theresult of a uniquely and remarkably successful interdisciplinary effort. 

The avowed intention ofthis cybernetics movement was to create a science of mind. In the eyes of theleaders of this movement, the study of mental phenomena had been far too longin the hands of psychologists and philosophers. In contrast, thesecyberneticians felt a calling to express the processes underlying mentalphenomena in explicit mechanisms and mathematical formalisms.[2](#2_7)

One of the bestillustrations of this mode of thinking (and its tangible consequences) was theseminal 1943 paper by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, “A Logical Calculus ofIdeas Immanent in Nervous Activity.”[3](#3_7)Two major leaps were taken in this article: first, the proposal that logic isthe proper discipline with which to understand the brain and mental activity,and second, the claim that the brain is a device that embodies logicalprinciples in its component elements or neurons. Each neuron was seen as athreshold device, which could be either active or inactive. Such simple neuronscould then be connected to one another, their interconnections performing therole of logical operations so that the entire brain could be regarded as adeductive machine. 

These ideas were centralfor the invention of digital computers.[4](#4_7)At that time, vacuum tubes were used to implement the McCulloch-Pitts neuronswhereas today we find silicon chips, but modern computers are still built onthe same so-called von Neumann architecture that has been made familiar withthe advent of personal computers. This major technological breakthrough alsolaid the basis for the dominant approach to the scientific study of mind thatwas to crystalize in the next decade as the cognitivist paradigm. 

In fact, Warren McCulloch,more than any other figure, can serve as an exemplar of the hopes and thedebates of these formative years. As can be gleaned from his collected papersin Embodiments of Mind,[5](#5_7)McCulloch was a mysterious and paradoxical figure whose tone was often poeticand prophetic. His influence seemed to wane during the later years of his life,but his legacy is being reconsidered as cognitive science becomes more awarethat a thorough intertwining of the philosophical, the empirical, and themathematical, which McCulloch’s investigations exemplified, seems the best wayto continue working. His favorite description for his enterprise was“experimental epistemology”—an expression not favored by current usage. It isone of those remarkable simultaneities in the history of ideas that in the1940s the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget coined the expression “geneticepistemology” for his influential work, and the Austrian zoologist KonradLorenz started to speak of an “evolutionary epistemology.” 

There was, of course,considerably more to this creative decade. For instance, there was extensivedebate over whether logic is indeed sufficient to understand the brain’soperations, since logic neglects the brain’s distributed qualities. (Thisdebate continues today, and we will consider it in more detail later,especially as it relates to the question of “levels of explanation” in thestudy of cognition.) Alternative models and theories were put forth, which forthe most part were to lie dormant until they were revived in the 1970s as animportant alternative in cognitive science. 

By 1953 the main actorsof the cybernetics movement, in contrast to their initial unity and vitality,were distanced from each other, and many died shortly thereafter. It was mainlythe idea of mind as logical calculation that continued. 

## Defining the Cognitivist Hypothesis 

Just as 1943 was clearlythe year in which the cybernetics phase was born, so 1956 was clearly the yearthat gave birth to cognitivism. During this year, at two meetings held atCambridge and Dartmouth, new voices (such as those of Herbert Simon, NoamChomsky, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy) put forth ideas that were to becomethe major guidelines for modern cognitive science.[6](#6_7)

The central intuitionbehind cognitivism is that intelligence—human intelligence included—soresembles computation in its essential characteristics that cognition canactually be defined as computations of symbolic representations. Clearly thisorientation could not have emerged without the basis laid during the previousdecade. The main difference was that one of the many original, tentative ideaswas now promoted to a full-blown hypothesis, with a strong desire to set itsboundaries apart from its broader, exploratory, and interdisciplinary roots,where the social and biological sciences figured preeminently with all theirmultifarious complexity. 

What exactly does itmean to say that cognition can be defined as computation? As we mentioned inchapter 1, a computation is an operation that is carried out or performed onsymbols (on elements that represent what they stand for). The key notion hereis that of representation or “intentionality,” the philosopher’s term for aboutness. The cognitivist argument is that intelligentbehavior presupposes the ability to represent the world as being certain ways.We therefore cannot explain cognitive behavior unless we assume that an agentacts by representing relevant features of her situations. To the extent thather representation of a situation is accurate, the agent’s behavior will besuccessful (all other things being equal). 

This notion ofrepresentation is—at least since the demise of behaviorism—relatively uncontroversial.What is controversial is the next step, which is the cognitivist claim that theonly way we can account for intelligence and intentionality is to hypothesizethat cognition consists of acting on the basis of representations that arephysically realized in the form of a symbolic code in the brain or a machine. 

According to thecognitivist, the problem that must be solved is how to correlate the ascriptionof intentional or representational states (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.)with the physical changes that an agent undergoes in acting. In other words, ifwe wish to claim that intentional states have causal properties, we have toshow not only how those states are physically possible but how they can causebehavior. Here is where the notion of symbolic computationcomes in. Symbols are both physical and have semantic values. Computations areoperations on symbols that respect or are constrained by those semantic values.In other words, a computation is fundamentally semantic or representational—wecannot make sense of the idea of computation (as opposed to some random orarbitrary operation on symbols) without adverting to the semantic relationsamong the symbolic expressions. (This is the meaning of the popular slogan “nocomputation without representation.”) A digital computer, however, operatesonly on the physical form of the symbols it computes; it has no access to theirsemantic value. Its operations are nonetheless semantically constrained becauseevery semantic distinction relevant to its program has been encoded in the syntax of its symbolic language by the programmers. In acomputer, that is, syntax mirrors or is parallel to the (ascribed) semantics.The cognitivist claim, then, is that this parallelism shows us how intelligenceand intentionality (semantics) are physically and mechanically possible. Thusthe hypothesis is that computers provide a mechanical model of thought or, inother words, that thought consists of physical, symbolic computations.Cognitive science becomes the study of such cognitive, physical symbol systems.[7](#7_7) 

To understand this hypothesis properly, it is crucial to realize thelevel at which it is proposed. The cognitivist is not claiming that if we wereto open up someone’s head and look at the brain, we would find little symbolsbeing manipulated there. Although the symbolic level is physically realized, itis not reducible to the physical level. This point is intuitively obvious whenwe remember that the same symbol can be realized in numerous physical forms.Because of this nonreducibility it is quite possible that what corresponds tosome symbolic expression at the physical level is a global, highly distributedpattern of brain activity. We will return to consider this idea later. For nowthe point to be emphasized is that in addition to the levels of physics andneurobiology, cognitivism postulates a distinct, irreducible symbolic level inthe explanation of cognition. Furthermore, since symbols are semantic items,cognitivists also postulate a third distinctly semantic or representationallevel. (The irreducibility of this level too is intuitively obvious when weremember that the same semantic value can be realized in numerous symbolicforms.)[8](#8_6) 

This multilevelconception of scientific explanation is quite recent and is one of the majorinnovations of cognitive science. The roots and initial formulation of theinnovation as a broad scientific idea can be traced back to the era ofcybernetics, but cognitivists have contributed greatly to its further rigorousphilosophical articulation.[9](#9_7) We would like the reader to keepthis idea in mind, for it will take on added significance when we turn todiscuss the related—though still controversial—notion of emergence.

The reader should alsonotice that the cognitivist hypothesis entails a very strong claim about therelations between syntax and semantics. As we mentioned, in a computer programthe syntax of the symbolic code mirrors or encodes its semantics. In the caseof human language, it is far from obvious that all of the semantic distinctionsrelevant in an explanation of behavior can be mirrored syntactically. Indeed,many philosophical arguments can be given against this idea.[10](#10_7)Furthermore, although we know where the semantic level of a computer’scomputations comes from (the programmers), we have no idea how the symbolicexpressions supposed by the cognitivist to be encoded in the brain would gettheir meaning. 

Since our concern inthis book is with experience and cognition in its basic, perceptual modality,we will not take up such issues about language in detail here. Nonetheless,they are worth pointing out, since they are problems that lie at the heart ofthe cognitivist endeavor. 

The cognitivist researchprogram can be summarized, then, as answers to the following fundamentalquestions: 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

Information processing as symbolic computation—rule-based manipulationof symbols. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through any device that can support and manipulate discrete functionalelements—the symbols. The system interacts only with the form of the symbols(their physical attributes), not their meaning. 

 

[Question 3: ]()

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

Answer: 

When the symbols appropriately represent some aspect of the real world,and the information processing leads to a successful solution of the problemgiven to the system. 

## Manifestationsof Cognitivism 

### Cognitivismin Artificial Intelligence 

The manifestations ofcognitivism are nowhere more visible than in artificial intelligence (AI),which is the literal construal of the cognitivist hypothesis. Over the yearsmany interesting theoretical advances and technological applications have beenmade within this orientation, such as expert systems, robotics, and imageprocessing. These results have been widely publicized, and so we need notdigress to provide specific examples here. 

Because of widerimplications, however, it is worth noting that AI and its cognitivist basisreached a dramatic climax in Japan’s ICOT Fifth Generation Program. For thefirst time since the war there is a national plan involving the efforts ofindustry, government, and universities, launched in 1981. The core of thisprogram is a cognitive device capable of understanding human language and ofwriting its own programs when presented with a task by an untrained user. Notsurprisingly, the heart of the ICOT program was the development of a series ofinterfaces of knowledge representation and problem solving based on PROLOG, ahigh-level programming language for predicate logic. The ICOT program hastriggered immediate responses from Europe and the United States, and there islittle question that this is a major commercial concern and engineeringbattlefield. (It is also worth noting that the Japanese government has launchedin 1990 the Sixth Generation Program based on connectionist models.) Althoughit is only one example, the ICOT program is a major illustration of theinseparability of science and technology in the study of cognition and of theeffects that this marriage has on the public at large. 

The cognitivisthypothesis has in AI its most literal construal. The complementary endeavor isthe study of natural, biologically implemented cognitive systems, especiallyhumans. Here, too, computationally characterizable representations have beenthe main explanatory tool. Mental representations are taken to be occurrences ofa formal system, and the mind’s activity is what gives these representationstheir attitudinal color—beliefs, desires, intentions, etc. Here, therefore,unlike AI, we find an interest in what the natural cognitive systems are reallylike, and it is assumed that their cognitive representations are about something for the system;they are said to be intentional in the sense indicated here. 

### Cognitivism and the Brain 

Another equallyimportant effect of cognitivism is the way it has shaped current views aboutthe brain. Even though in theory the symbolic level of cognitivism iscompatible with many views about the brain, in practice almost all ofneurobiology (and its huge body of empirical evidence) has become permeatedwith the cognitivist, information-processing perspective. More often than not,the origins and assumptions of this perspective are not even questioned.[11](#11_4) 

The exemplar of thisapproach is the celebrated studies of the visual cortex, an area of the brainwhere one can easily detect electrical responses from neurons when the animalis presented with a visual image. It was reported early on that it was possibleto classify cortical neurons, such as feature detectors, responding to certainattributes of the object being presented—its orientation, contrast, velocity,color, and so on. In line with the cognitivist hypothesis, these results havebeen seen as the biological basis for the notion that the brain picks up visualinformation from the retina through the feature-specific neurons in the cortex,and the information is then passed on to later stages in the brain for furtherprocessing (conceptual categorization, memory associations, and eventuallyaction).[12](#12_3) 

In its most extremeform, this view of the brain is expressed in Barlow’s “grandmother cell”doctrine, where there is a correspondence between concepts (such as the conceptsomeone has of her grandmother) or percepts and specific neurons.[13](#13_3)(This is equivalent to Al detectors and labeled lines.) This extreme view iswaning in popularity now,[14](#14_3) but the basic idea that the brainis an information-processing device that responds selectively to features ofthe environment remains as the dominant core of modern neuroscience and in thepublic’s understanding. 

### Cognitivismin Psychology 

Psychology is thediscipline that most people assume to be the study of mind. Psychology predatescognitive science and cognitivism and is not coextensive with either of them.What influence has cognitivism had on psychology? To understand something ofthis, we need some historical background in psychology. 

We have alreadymentioned introspectionism and its differences from mindfulness meditation. Itmay be that when anyone first thinks to inquire about the mind, there are alimited number of possibilities of how to proceed, and turning to one’s ownmind is one of the universal strategies that will occur. This track, developedby the meditative traditions of India, was aborted for psychology in the Westwhen the nineteenth-century introspectionists, lacking a method of mindfulness,tried to treat the mind as an external object, with disastrous results forinterobserver agreement. The breakdown of introspectionism intononcommensurable, warring laboratories left experimental psychology with aprofound distrust of self-knowledge as a legitimate procedure in psychology.Introspectionism was replaced by the dominant school of behaviorism. 

One obvious alternativeto looking inward to the mind is to look outward at behavior; we even have thefolk saying, “Actions speak louder than words.” Behaviorism was particularlycompatible with the early twentieth-century positivist zeitgeist of disembodiedobjectivism in science, for it eliminated mind entirely from its psychology.According to behaviorism, although one could objectively observe inputs to theorganism (stimuli) and outputs (behavior) and could investigate the lawfulrelationships between inputs and outputs over time, the organism itself (bothits mind and its biological body) was a black box that was methodologicallyunapproachable by behavioral science (hence no rules, no symbols, nocomputations). Behaviorism completely dominated North American experimentalpsychology from the 1920s until fairly recently. 

The first signs of a postbehaviorist experimental cognitive psychologybegan to appear in the late 1950s. The trick of these early researchers whowere still, strictly speaking, positivist, was to find experimental means fordefining and measuring the effect of a given forbidden mentalistic phenomenon.Let us take mental images as an example. 

A mental image isundisputably in the black box for a behaviorist; it is not publicly observable,so one cannot have observer agreement about it. Researchers, however, graduallydevised demonstrations of the pragmatic effects of mental images. Instructingan experimental subject to hold a mental image during a signal detection tasklowers the accuracy of the detection, and, furthermore, this effect is modalityspecific (a visual image interferes more in a visual detection task than anauditory task, and vice versa).[15](#15_3) Such experiments legitimateimagery even in behaviorist terminology—imagery is a powerful interveningvariable. Furthermore, experiments began to explore the behavior of mentalimages in themselves, often showing that they had properties like those ofperceptual images. In delightfully ingenious experiments, Kosslyn showed thatmental visual images appear to be scanned in real time,[16](#16_3)and Shepard and Metzler showed that mental images appear to be rotated in realtime just as perceptual visual images are.[17](#17_3)Studies of other formerly mentalistic (now called cognitive) phenomena began tobe performed in perception, memory, language, problem solving, concepts, anddecision making. 

What influence didcognitivism have on this emerging experimental investigation of the mind?Interestingly, the initial effect of cognitivism on psychology was extremelyliberating. The computer metaphor of the mind could be used to formulateexperimental hypotheses or even to legitimate one’s theory simply byprogramming it. Although the programs were almost entirely cognitivist(psychological processes were modeled in terms of explicit rules, symbols, andrepresentations), the overall effect was to breach the constraints ofbehaviorist orthodoxy and admit into psychology long-suppressed, commonsenseunderstanding of the mind. For example, developmental psycholinguistics could nowexplore openly the idea that children learn the vocabulary and grammar of theirlanguage not as reinforced, paired associates but as hypotheses about correctadult speech that develop with their cognitive capacities and experience.[18](#18_3) Motivation could be understood asmore than hours of deprivation; one could now talk of cognitive representationsof goals and plans.[19](#19_3) The social system was not just a complexstimulus; it could be modeled in the mind as representations of scripts andsocial schemas.[20](#20_3) One could speak of the humaninformation processor as a lay scientist, testing hypotheses and makingmistakes.[21](#21_3) In short, the introduction of thecomputer metaphor in a very general, albeit implicitly cognitivist, sense intocognitive psychology allowed an explosion of commonsense theory and its operationalizationinto computer models and human research. 

Strict cognitivism inits explicit form, on the other hand, places strong constraints on theory andhas generated primarily philosophical debate. Let us return to mental imageryas an example. In cognitivism, mental imagery, like any other cognitivephenomenon, can be no more than the manipulation of symbols by computationalrules. Yet Shepard’s and Kosslyn’s experiments have demonstrated that mentalimages perform in a continuous fashion in real time, very like visualperception. Does this refute cognitivism? A hard-line cognitivist, such asPylyshyn, argues that images are simply subjective epiphenomena (as they werefor behaviorism) of more fundamental symbolic computations.[22](#22_3)Attempting to bridge the rift between data and cognitivist theory, Kosslyn hasformulated a model by which images are generated in the mind by the same rulesthat generate images in computer displays: the interaction of languagelikeoperations and picturelike operations together generate the internal eye.[23](#23_3) One current view of the imagerydebate is that since, at best, the imagery research demonstrates the similarityof imagery to perception, this simply points us to the need for a viableaccount of perception.[24](#24_1) 

### Cognitivism and Psychoanalysis 

We stated earlier thatpsychoanalytic theory had mirrored much of the development of cognitivescience. In fact, psychoanalysis was explicitly cognitivist in its inception.[25](#25_1) Freud attended Brentano’s coursein Vienna, as did Husserl, and he fully endorsed the representational andintentional view of the mind. For Freud, nothing could affect behavior unlessit were mediated by a representation, even an instinct. “An instinct can neverbe an object of consciousness—only the idea that represents the instinct. Evenin the unconscious, moreover, it can only be represented by the idea.”[26](#26_1) Within this framework, Freud’sgreat discovery was that not all representations were accessible toconsciousness; he never seemed to doubt that the unconscious, for all that itmight operate on a different symbol system than the conscious, was fullysymbolic, fully intentional, and fully representational. 

Freud’s descriptions ofmental structures and processes are sufficiently general and metaphorical thatthey have proved translatable (with arguable degrees of loss of meaning) intothe language of other psychological systems. In the Anglo-American world, oneextreme was Dollard and Miller’s hotly contested retheorizing of Freudiandiscoveries in terms of behaviorist-based learning theory.[27](#27_1)More relevant for us was Erdelyi’s rather placidly accepted (perhaps because ofFreud’s preexisting cognitivist “metaphysics”) translation intocognitivist-based information-processing language.[28](#28_1)For example, Freud’s concept of repression/censorship becomes, in cognitivistterms, the matching of information from a perception or idea to a criterionlevel for acceptable accounts of anxiety: if it is above the criterion, it goesto a stop-processing/accessing information box, from whence it is shunted backto the unconscious; if below the criterion, it is allowed into the preconsciousand, perhaps, then into the conscious. After another criterion match in thedecision tree, it is either allowed into behavior or suppressed. Does such adescription add anything to Freud? It certainly serves to translate suchnotions as the Freudian unconscious into what is taken to be a “scientific”currency of the day. It is also fair to say that many contemporary post-Freudiantheorists in Europe—such as Jacques Lacan—would disagree: such theorizingmisses the central spirit of the psychoanalytic journey—to move beyond the trapof representations, including those about the unconscious. 

It is presentlyfashionable to say that Freud “decentered” the self; what he actually did wasto divide the self into several basic selves. Freud was not a strictcognitivist in the Pylyshyn sense: the unconscious had the same type ofrepresentations as the conscious, all of which could, at least theoretically,become, or have been, conscious. Modern strict cognitivism has a far moreradical and alienating view of unconscious processing. It is to this issue thatwe now turn as we discuss the meaning of cognitivism for our experience. 

## Cognitivismand Human Experience 

What implications doesthis cognitivist research program have for an understanding of our experience?We wish to emphasize two related points: (1) cognitivism postulates mental orcognitive processes of which we are not only unaware but of which we cannot beaware, and (2) cognitivism is thereby led to embrace the idea that the self orcognizing subject is fundamentally fragmented or nonunified. These two pointswill become considerably intertwined as we proceed. 

As the reader mightrecall, our first point has already appeared when we presented the tensionbetween science and experience to which cognitive science gives rise. There wequoted Daniel Dennett’s claim that all cognitivist theories are theories ofwhat Dennett calls the “sub-personal level.” By this phrase, Dennett means thatcognitivism postulates mental (not just physical and biological) mechanisms and processes that are not accessible to the“personal level” of consciousness, especially self-consciousness. In other words,one cannot discern in conscious awareness or self-conscious introspection anyof the cognitive structures and processes that are postulated to account forcognitive behavior. Indeed, if cognition is fundamentally symbolic computation,this discrepancy between personal and subpersonal immediately follows, sincepresumably none of us has any awareness of computing in an internal, symbolicmedium when we think. 

It is possible tooverlook the depth of this challenge to our self-understanding, largely becauseof our post-Freudian belief in the unconscious. There is a difference, however,between what we usually mean by “unconscious” and the sense in which mentalprocesses are said to be unconscious in cognitivism: we usually suppose thatwhat is unconscious can be brought to consciousness—if not throughself-conscious reflection, then through a disciplined procedure such aspsychoanalysis. Cognitivism, on the other hand, postulates processes that aremental but that cannot be brought to consciousness at all. Thus we are notsimply unaware of the rules that govern the generation of mental images or ofthe rules that govern visual processing; we could not be aware of these rules.Indeed, it is typically noted that if such cognitive processes could be madeconscious, then they could not be fast and automatic and so could not functionproperly. In one formulation these cognitive processes are even considered tobe “modular” (to comprise distinct subsystems that cannot be penetrated byconscious mental activity).[29](#29_1) Thus cognitivism challenges ourconviction that consciousness and the mind either amount to the same thing orthere is an essential or necessary connection between them. 

Of course, Freud toochallenged the idea that the mind and consciousness are the same. Furthermore,he certainly realized that to distinguish between the mind and consciousnessentails the disunity of the self or cognizing subject, a point to which weshall turn shortly. It is not clear, however, whether Freud took the furtherstep of calling into question the idea that there is an essential or necessaryconnection between the mind and consciousness. As Dennett notes, Freud, in hisargument for unconscious beliefs, desires, and motivations, left open thepossibility that these unconscious processes belonged to a fragment ofourselves hidden in the depths of the psyche.[30](#30_1)Although it is not clear the extent to which Freud meant such a fragmentationliterally, it is clear that cognitive science does take a literal, if nothomuncular, view. As Dennett puts it, “Although the new [cognitivist] theoriesabound with deliberately fanciful homunculus metaphors—subsystems like littlepeople in the brain sending messages back and forth, asking for help, obeyingand volunteering—the actual subsystems are deemed to be unproblematic nonconscious bits of organic machinery, as utterly lackingin point of view or inner life as a kidney or kneecap.”[31](#31_1)In other words, the characterization of these “sub-personal” systems in“fanciful homunculus metaphors” is only provisional, for eventually all suchmetaphors are “discharged”—they are traded in for the storm of activity amongsuch selfless processes as neural networks or AI data structures.[32](#32_1)

Our pretheoretical,everyday conviction, however, is that cognition and consciousness—especiallyself-consciousness—belong together in the same domain. Cognitivism runsdirectly counter to this conviction: in determining the domain of cognition, itexplicitly cuts across the conscious/unconscious distinction. The domain ofcognition consists of those systems that must be seen as having a distinctrepresentational level, not necessarily of those systems that are conscious.Some representational systems are, of course, conscious, but they need not beto have representations or intentional states. Thus for cognitivists, cognitionand intention­ality (representation) are the inseparable pair, not cognitionand consciousness. 

This theoreticaldivision of the domain of cognition is considered by cognitivists to be “anempirical discovery of no small importance”[33](#33_1)and indicates, again, the remarkable mutation wrought by cognitivism. But now aproblem arises: we seem to be losing our grip on something that is undeniablyclose and familiar—our sense of self. If consciousness—to say nothing ofself-consciousness—is not essential for cognition, and if, in the case ofcognitive systems that are conscious, such as ourselves, consciousnessamounts to only one kind of mental process, then just what is the cognizingsubject? Is it the collection of all mental processes, both conscious andunconscious? Or is it simply one kind of mental process, such as consciousness,among all the others? In either case, our sense of self is challenged, for wetypically suppose that to be a self is to have a coherent and unified “point ofview,” a stable and constant vantage point from which to think, perceive, andact. Indeed, this sense that we have (are?) a self seems so incontrovertiblethat its calling into question or denial—even by science—strikes us as absurd.And yet, if someone were to turn the tables and ask us to look for the self, wewould be hard pressed to find it. Dennett, as usual, makes this point withflair: “You enter the brain through the eye, march up the optic nerve, roundand round the cortex, looking behind every neuron, and then before you know it,you emerge into daylight on the spike of a motor nerve impulse, scratching yourhead and wondering where the self is.”[34](#34_1)

Our problem, however,goes even deeper. It is one thing to be unable to find a coherent and unifiedself amid the furious storm of subpersonal activity. This inability wouldcertainly challenge our sense of self, but the challenge would be limited. Wecould still suppose that there really is a self but that we simply cannot findit in this fashion. Perhaps, as Jean-Paul Sartre held, the self is too close,and so we cannot uncover it by turning back upon ourselves. The cognitivistchallenge, however, is much more serious. According to cognitivism, cognitioncan proceed without consciousness, for there is no essential or necessaryconnection between them. Now whatever else we suppose the self to be, wetypically suppose that consciousness is its central feature. It follows, then,that cognitivism challenges our conviction that the most central feature of theself is needed for cognition. In other words, the cognitivist challenge doesnot consist simply in asserting that we cannot find the self; it consists,rather, in the further implication that the self is not even needed forcognition. 

At this point, thetension between science and experience should be obvious and tangible. Ifcognition can proceed without the self, then why do we nonetheless have theexperience of self? We cannot simply dismiss this experience withoutexplanation. 

Until recently, mostphilosophers nonchalantly shrugged off this problem by arguing that theperplexities surrounding it are just not relevant to the purposes of cognitivescience.[35](#35_1) This mood, however, has begun tochange. Indeed, one prominent cognitive scientist, Ray Jackendoff, has recentlypublished a book that attempts to address just these issues.[36](#36_1)Jackendoff’s work is important, for it squarely faces the problematic relationsamong consciousness, mind, and self uncovered by cognitivism. His work is alsoinstructive for our purposes, for it provides a paradigm of how the purelytheoretical treatment of the relation between science and experience is bothmethodologically and empirically incomplete. For these reasons, we willconclude this chapter with a brief consideration of Jackendoff’s project. 

## Experience and the Computational Mind 

We have now seen that,in the hands of cognitivism, the cognizing subject is split in two: cognitionconsists, on the one hand, of unconscious symbolic computation and, on theother hand, of conscious experience. Jackendoff’s work focuses on the problematicrelation between these two aspects of cognition, which he calls the computational mind and the phenomenologicalmind. 

It is important toappreciate just how problematic the relation between the computational mind andthe phenomenological mind is. The problem centers on how intentionality andconsciousness are related. We have seen that cognitivism draws a sharp andfundamental distinction between these two aspects of cognition. Our cognition,however, seems to be directed toward the world in a way that intimatelyinvolves consciousness. Thus notice that our cognition is directed toward theworld in a certain way: it is directed toward theworld as we experience it. For example, we perceivethe world to be three-dimensional, macroscopic, colored, etc.; we do notperceive it as composed of subatomic particles. Thus our cognition is directedtoward an experiential world, or in the terms of phenomenology, toward a lived world. How, then, if intentionality and consciousnessare fundamentally distinct, does cognition come to be about the world as weconsciously experience it? This problem is paramount, for as Jackendoff notes,by postulating a computational mind that is inaccessible to consciousness,cognitivism “offers no explication of what a conscious experience is” (p. 20). 

Jackendoff calls thisproblem the “mind-mind problem,” for it centers on the relation between thecomputational mind and the phenomenological mind. In his words (p. 20), 

The upshot is that psychology now has not two domains to worry about,the brain and mind, but three: the brain, the computational mind, and thephenomenological mind. Consequently, Descartes’ formulation of the mind-bodyproblem is split into two separate issues. The “phenomenological mind-bodyproblem” … is, How can a brain have experiences? The “computational mind-bodyproblem” is, How can a brain accomplish reasoning? In addition, we have themind-mind problem, namely, What is the relationshipbetween computational states and experience? 

It should be apparentfrom our presentation of cognitivism that the motivation for the cognitivisthypothesis has been what Jackendoff calls the “computational mind-bodyproblem,” that is, the problem of how thought construed as reasoning isphysically and mechanically possible. The “mind-mind problem,” on the otherhand, corresponds to the problem of intentionality and consciousness in itsfull-blown form: How is cognition as symbolic computation related to the worldas experienced? 

How, then, doesJackendoff propose to tackle this issue? His basic idea is that “the elementsof conscious awareness are caused by/supported by/projected from informationand processes of the computational mind” (p. 23). In other words, he proposesto consider conscious awareness “as an externalizationor projection of some subset of elements of thecomputational mind” (p. 23). The research program, then, is to determine whichelements “project” or “support” conscious awareness. Jackendoff argues thatthese elements correspond to intermediate-level representationsin the computational mind (to representations that lie midway between the most“peripheral” or sensory level and the most “central” or thoughtlike level). 

Jackendoff successivelyrefines this “intermediate-level theory” throughout the course of his book. Weshall return to one of these refinements after we have presented the enactiveview of cognition. At this point we wish simply to emphasize two importantconsequences that follow from his basic idea of consciousness as a projectionfrom intermediate levels of representation in the computational mind. The firstconsequence is that to develop his computational theory, Jackendoff requiresexperiential or phenomenological evidence. The second is that his theoryreveals the disunity of the cognizing subject. These two consequences bring tothe fore the necessity of complementing cognitive science with a pragmatic,mindful, open-ended approach to human experience, such as we find in themindfulness/awareness tradition. 

Consider first thataccording to Jackendoff’s theory the organization of conscious awareness isdetermined by the computational mind. As Jackendoff puts it, “Everyphenomenological distinction is caused by/supported by/projected from acorresponding computational distinction” (p. 24). It follows, then, thatphenomenological distinctions constrain computational models. In other words,any computational model of the mind that purports to explain thephenomenological mind must have the resources to explain all of thedistinctions that we make in conscious experience. Jackendoff is well aware ofthis consequence, for he writes, “The empirical force of this hypothesis is tobring phenomenological evidence to bear on thecomputational theory. The computational theory must be sufficiently expressive(must contain sufficient distinctions of the proper sorts) to make the world ofawareness possible. Thus, if there is a phenomenological distinction that isnot yet expressed by our current computational theory, the theory must beenriched or revised” (p. 25). 

In this paragraph, wesee again how the fundamental circularity with which we began this book comesto the fore. To explain cognition, we turn to investigate ourstructure—understood in the present context as our computational mind. Butsince it is also cognition as experience that we wish to explain, we must turnback and attend to the kinds of distinctions we draw in experience—thephenomenological mind. Having attended to experience in this way, we can thenturn back to enrich and revise our computational theory, and so on. Our pointis not at all that this circle is vicious. Rather, our point is that we cannotsituate ourselves properly within this circle without a disciplined andopen-ended approach from the side of experience. 

To appreciate this point,let us ask, How are we to specify the appropriate phenomenological orexperiential distinctions? Are these distinctions simply given to us by virtueof our being experiencing creatures? Jackendoff appears to think so, foralthough he admits that experiential evidence constrains his theory, henonetheless treats experience as something that requires no disciplinedprocedure for its investigation beyond “the hope that disagreements aboutphenomenology can be settled in an atmosphere of mutual trust” (p. 275). Thisis quite an assumption for a field that saw the demise of introspectionismbecause of its total inability to agree on anything and that can readily seepeople and nations disagreeing constantly over the nature of even simplematters of experience. Jackendoff assumes that everyday—largelymindless—experience provides access to all the relevant phenomenologicalevidence and that the phenomenological quest is limited to just that largelymindless state. He considers neither the possibility that conscious awarenesscan be progressively developed beyond its everyday form (a strange omissionconsidering his interest in musical cognition) nor that such development can beused to provide direct insight into the structure and constitution ofexperience. These are assumptions that Jackendoff is forced to make because ourWestern tradition neither provides a critique of mindless phenomenologizing norprovides any method, other than hit or miss hand waving, to investigate thephenomenological mind. We find this all the more telling because Jackendoffdemonstrates such phenomenological acumen and brilliant synergistic theorizing.There is clearly the need for the disciplined, open-ended approach toexperience if such matters are to be discussed. 

The relevance of amindful, open-ended stance toward experience again becomes apparent when weconsider our second point, which is that Jackendoff’s theory implies thedisunity of the cognizing subject. We typically suppose that consciousnessunifies and grounds all the disparate elements of one’s self—one’s thoughts,feelings, perceptions, etc. The phrase “unity of consciousness” refers to theidea that one understands all of one’s experiences as happening to a singleself. As Jackendoff rightly notes, however, there is an equally obvious disunity in consciousness, for the forms in which we can beconsciously aware depend considerably on the modalities of experience. Thusvisual conscious awareness is markedly distinct from auditory awareness, andboth are markedly distinct from tactile awareness. Since, as we have just seen,Jackendoff’s computational theory is constrained by phenomenologicaldistinctions, he must give some account of this experiential disunity.Jackendoff suggests that each form of conscious awareness is derived orprojected from a different set of representational structures in thecomputational mind (p. 52): 

[The hypothesis thatemerges from these considerations is that each modality of awareness comes froma different level or set of levels of representation. The disunity of awarenessthus arises from the fact that each of the relevant levels involves its ownspecial repertoire of distinctions. … ]()

[This theory] goes against the grain of the prevailing approaches toconsciousness, which start with the premise that consciousness is unified andthen try to locate a unique source for it. [This theory] claims thatconsciousness is fundamentally not unified and that one should seek multiplesources. 

In the previous section,we saw that cognitivism implies the disunity of the cognizing subject becauseit draws a fundamental distinction between consciousness and intentionality.Jackendoff takes this disunity one step further, however, by claiming thatconsciousness itself is fundamentally disunified. Furthermore, his view ismotivated not by the problem of how cognition is physically possible (the“computational mind-body problem”) but rather by the problem of how thecomputational mind generates conscious experience (the “mind-mind” problem).For this reason Jackendoff does not simply assert the disunity of the cognizingsubject on computational grounds; he also respects and attends to thephenomenological evidence for disunity. Indeed, it is precisely this disunitythat Jackendoff uses to build a bridge between the computational mind and thephenomenological mind (p. 51). 

This considerableadvance, however, makes the tension between science and experience only moreapparent. It must be remembered that Jackendoff attends to conscious experiencebecause he holds that it results from an underlying computational organization.Thus for Jackendoff the distinctions present in the phenomenological mind arenot made by the phenomenological mind; they are,rather, projected into the phenomenological mind by the computational mind.Indeed, Jackendoff explicitly rejects the idea that consciousness has anycausal efficacy; instead he holds that all causality takes place at thecomputational level. He is thus led to embrace a consequence that he himselfadmits to be unpleasant: if consciousness has no causal efficacy, then it canhave no effects and so “is not good for anything” (p. 26). 

With this consequence weare confronted in a more extreme form with the effects of the cognitivistseparation of intentionality and consciousness. If cognition can proceedwithout consciousness, if consciousness itself is “not good for anything,” thenwhy are we consciously aware, both of ourselves and of the world? Doescognitive science require that we treat experience as, in the end, simplyepiphenomenal? 

Some cognitivescientists appear to be willing to embrace just this conclusion. They shrugtheir shoulders and say, “So much the worse for experience,” as if experiencecould be blamed for not living up to the demands of a theory. And yet what doessuch a conclusion mean to these very same scientists and philosophers, when notengaged in theoretical reflection? Does it change in any way the flow of livedexperience? Is the philosophical conclusion itself, as we fear it is in mostmodern philosophy, an epiphenomenon? 

We have already arguedthat these two responses—the dismissal of experience on the one hand and theunquestioned acceptance of it on the other—are extreme and lead to an impasse.In so arguing, we obviously imply the possibility of some other, middle way.The next several chapters are devoted to the exploration of such a middle wayand have the experience of self as their theme. In the next chapter we turn toface directly the “I of the storm” in a reflection on selfless minds and humanexperience. As we will see, the disunity of the self and of consciousawareness, which modern-day cognitivism has uncovered, is in fact a focal pointof the entire mindfulness/awareness tradition.

# [4 ]()The I of the Storm 

## WhatDo We Mean by “Self”? 

At every moment of ourlives there is something going on, some experience. We see, hear, smell, taste,touch, think. We can be pleased, angry, afraid, tired, perplexed, interested,agonizingly self-conscious, or absorbed in a pursuit. I can feel that I am being overwhelmed by my ownemotions, that I have greater worth when praised by another, that I amdestroyed by a loss. What is this self, this ego-center, that appears anddisappears, that seems so constant yet so fragile, so familiar and yet soelusive? 

We are caught in acontradiction. On the one hand, even a cursory attention to experience shows usthat our experience is always changing and, furthermore, is always dependent ona particular situation. To be human, indeed to be living, is always to be in asituation, a context, a world. We have no experience of anything that ispermanent and independent of these situations. Yet most of us are convinced ofour identities: we have a personality, memories and recollections, and plansand anticipations, which seem to come together in a coherent point of view, acenter from which we survey the world, the ground on which we stand. How couldsuch a point of view be possible if it were not rooted in a single,independent, truly existing self or ego? 

This question is themeeting ground of everything in this book: cognitive science, philosophy, andthe meditative tradition of mindfulness/awareness. We wish to make a sweepingclaim: all of the reflective traditions in human history—philosophy, science,psychoanalysis, religion, meditation—have challenged the naive sense of self.No tradition has ever claimed to discover an independent, fixed, or unitaryself within the world of experience. Let us give the voice for this to DavidHume’s famous passage: “For my part, when I enter most intimately into whatI call myself, I always stumble on some particularperception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain orpleasure. I never can catch myself at any timewithout a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception.”[1](#1_9) Such an insight directlycontradicts our ongoing sense of self. 

It is thiscontradiction, the incommensurability of the outcome of reflection andexperience, that has provoked us on the journey in this book. We believe thatmany non-Western (even contemplative) traditions, and all Western traditions,deal with this contradiction simply by turning away from it, refusing toconfront it, a withdrawal that can take one of two forms. The usual way issimply to ignore it. Hume, for example, unable to find the self as he reflectedin his study, chose to withdraw and immerse himself in a game of backgammon; heresigned himself to the separation of life and reflection. Jean-Paul Sartreexpresses this by saying that we are “condemned” to a belief in the self. Thesecond tactic is to postulate a transcendental self that can never be known toexperience, such as the atman of the Upanishads orthe transcendental ego of Kant.[2](#2_9) (Noncontemplative traditions, ofcourse, can just not notice the contradiction—for example, self-concept theoryin psychology.)[3](#3_9) The major—and perhapsonly—tradition that we know that directly confronts this contradiction and thathas spoken to it for a long time arose from the practice ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. 

We have already described mindfulness/awareness practice as a gradualdevelopment of the ability to be present with one’s mind and body not only informal meditation but in the experiences of everyday life. Beginning meditatorsare usually amazed at the tumultuous activity of their mind as perceptions,thoughts, feelings, desires, fears, and every other kind of mental contentpursue each other endlessly like a cat chasing its tail. As the meditatorsdevelop some stability of mindfulness/awareness so that they have periods whenthey are not constantly (to use traditional images) sucked into the whirlpoolor thrown from a horse, they begin to have insight into what the mind, as it isexperienced, is really like. Experiences, they notice, are impermanent. This isnot just the leaves-fall, maidens-wither, and kings-are-forgotten type ofimpermance (traditionally called gross impermance) with which all people arehauntingly familiar but a personal penetrating impermanence of the activity ofthe mind itself. Moment by moment new experiences happen and are gone. It is arapidly shifting stream of momentary mental occurrences. Furthermore, the shiftinessincludes the perceiver as much as the perceptions. There is no experiencer,just as Hume noticed, who remains constant to receive experiences, no landingplatform for experience. This actual experiential sense of no one home iscalled selflessness or egolessness.Moment by moment the meditator also sees the mind pulling away from its senseof impermance and lack of self, sees it grasping experiences as though theywere permanent, commenting on experiences as though there were a constantperceiver to comment, seeking any mental entertainment that will disruptmindfulness, and restlessly fleeing to the next preoccupation, all with a senseof constant struggle. This undercurrent of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, andunsatisfactoriness that pervades experience is called Dukkha,usually translated as suffering. Suffering arises quite naturally and thengrows as the mind seeks to avoid its natural grounding in impermanence and lackof self. 

The tension between theongoing sense of self in ordinary experience and the failure to find that selfin reflection is of central importance in Buddhism—the origin of humansuffering is just this tendency to grasp onto and build a sense of self, anego, where there is none. As meditators catch glimpses of impermanence,selflessness, and suffering (known as the three marks of existence) and someinkling that the pervasiveness of suffering (known as the First Noble Truth)may have its origin in their own self-grasping (known as the Second NobleTruth), they may develop some real motivation and urgency to persevere in theirinvestigation of mind. They try to develop a strong and stable insight andinquisitiveness into the moment to moment arising of mind. They are encouragedto investigate: How does this moment arise? What areits conditions? What is the nature of “my” reactivity to it? Where does theexperience of “I” occur? 

The search for how theself arises is thus a way of asking, “What and where is mind?” in a direct andpersonal way. The initial spirit of inquisitiveness in these questions isactually not unlike Descartes’s Meditations, thoughthis statement might surprise some people since Descartes has received such badpress these days. Descartes’s initial decision to rely not on the word of theChurch fathers but rather on what his own mind could discern in reflectionobviously partakes of the spirit of self-reliant investigation, as doesphenomenology. Descartes, however, stopped short: His famous “I think, I am”simply leaves untouched the nature of the “I” that thinks. True, Descartes didinfer that the “I” is fundamentally a thinking thing, but here he went too far:the only certainty that “I am” carries is that of being a thought. If Descarteshad been fully rigorous, mindful, and attentive, he would not have jumped tothe conclusion that I am a thinking thing (rescogitans); rather he would have kept his attention on the very process of mind itself. 

In mindfulness/awarenesspractice, the awareness of thinking, emotions, and bodily sensations becomesquite pronounced in the basic restlessness that we normally experience. Topenetrate that experience, to discern what it is and how it arises, some typesof mindfulness meditation direct the meditator to attend to experience asprecisely and dispassionately as possible. It is only through a pragmatic,open-ended reflection that we can examine systematically and directly thisrestlessness that we usually ignore. As the contents of experiencearise—discursive thoughts, emotional tonalities, bodily sensations—the meditatoris attentive not by becoming concerned with the contents of the thoughts or with the sense of Ithinking but rather by simply noting “thinking” and directing his attention tothe never-ceasing process of that experience. 

Just as the mindfulnessmeditator is amazed to discover how mindless he is in daily life, so the firstinsights of the meditator who begins to question the self are normally notegolessness but the discovery of total egomania. Constantly one thinks, feels,and acts as though one had a self to protect and preserve. The slightestencroachment on the self’s territory (a splinter in the finger, a noisyneighbor) arouses fear and anger. The slightest hope of self-enhancement (gain,praise, fame, pleasure) arouses greed and grasping. Any hint that a situationis irrelevant to the self (waiting for a bus, meditating) arouses boredom. Suchimpulses are instinctual, automatic, pervasive, and powerful. They arecompletely taken for granted in daily life. The impulses are certainly there,constantly occurring, yet in the light of the questioning meditator, do theymake any sense? What kind of self does he think he has to warrant suchattitudes? 

The Tibetan teacherTsultrim Gyamtso puts the dilemma this way: 

To have any meaning such a self has to be lasting, for if it perishedevery moment one would not be so concerned about what was going to happen to itthe next moment; it would not be one’s “self” anymore. Again it has to besingle. If one had no separate identity why should one worry about whathappened to one’s “self” any more than one worried about anyone else’s? It hasto be independent or there would be no sense in saying “I did this” or “I havethat.” If one had no independent existence there would be no-one to claim theactions and experiences as its own … We all act as if we had lasting, separate,and independent selves that it is our constant preoccupation to protect andfoster. It is an unthinking habit that most of us would normally be mostunlikely to question or explain. However, all our suffering is associated withthis pre-occupation. All loss and gain, pleasure and pain arise because weidentify so closely with this vague feeling of selfness that we have. We are soemotionally involved with and attached to this “self ” that we take it forgranted. … The meditator does not speculate about this “self.” He does not havetheories about whether it does or does not exist. Instead he just trainshimself to watch … how his mind clings to the idea of self and “mine” and howall his sufferings arise from this attachment. At the same time he lookscarefully for that self. He tries to isolate it from all his other experiences.Since it is the culprit as far as all his suffering is concerned, he wants tofind it and identify it. The irony is that however much he tries, he does notfind anything that corresponds to the self.[4](#4_9)

If there is noexperienced self, then how is it that we think there is? What is the origin ofour self-serving habits? What is it in experience that we take for a self? 

## Looking for a Self in the Aggregates 

We now turn to some ofthe categories in the Buddhist teachings called the Abhidharma.[5](#5_9) This term refers to a collectionof texts that forms one of the three divisions of the Buddhist canon (the othertwo are the Vinaya, which contains ethical precepts,and the Sutras, which contain the speeches of theBuddha). Based on the Abhidharma texts and their later commentaries, thereemerged a tradition of analytic investigation of the nature of experience,which is still taught and used in contemplation by most Buddhist schools. TheAbhidharma contains various sets of categories for examining the arising of thesense of self. These are not intended as ontological categories, such as onefinds, for example, in Aristotle’s Metaphysics.Rather, these categories serve on the one hand as simple descriptions ofexperience and on the other hand as pointers toward investigation.[6](#6_9)

The most popular set of these categories, one that is common to allBuddhist schools, is known as the five aggregates. (The Sanscrit termtranslated as “aggregate” is skandha, which literallymeans “heap.” The story goes that when the Buddha first taught this frameworkfor examining experience, he used piles of grain to stand for each aggregate.)The five aggregates are 

1.   Forms 

2.  Feelings/sensations 

3.  Perceptions(discernments)/impulses 

4.  Dispositional formations 

5.  Consciousnesses[7](#7_9)

The first of the fiveaggregates is considered to be based on the physical or material; the remainingfour are mental. All five together constitute the psychophysical complex thatmakes up a person and that makes up each moment of experience.[8](#8_8)We will examine the way in which we take each of these to be ourselves and willquery whether we can find something in the aggregates that will answer to ourbasic, emotional, reactional conviction in the reality of self. In other words,we will be looking for a full-blown, really existing ego-self—some lasting selfthat would serve as the object of our emotional conviction that there really isa ground underneath the dependent, impermanent, everyday personality. 

### Forms

This category refers tothe body and the physical environment. It does so, however, strictly in termsof the senses—the six sense organs and the corresponding objects of thoseorgans.[9](#9_9) They are the eye and visibleobjects, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, thebody and touchables, and the mind and thoughts. The sense organs do not referto the gross external organ but to the actual physical mechanism of perception.The mind organ (there is debate in the tradition as to just what physicalstructure that is) and thoughts are treated as a sense and its object becausethat is how they appear in experience: we feel that we perceive our thoughtswith our mind just as we perceive a visible object with our eye. 

We might point out thateven at this level of analysis we have already departed from the usual idea ofan abstract, disembodied observer who, like a cognitive entity parachuted intoa ready-made world, encounters matter as a separate and independent category.Here, as in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, our encounter with the physical isalready situated and embodied. Matter is described experientially. 

Is our body our self?Think how important our body and possessions are to us, how terrified we becomeif the body or important possessions are threatened, how angry or depressed webecome if they are damaged. Think of how much effort, money, and emotion wespend on feeding, grooming, and caring for the body. Emotionally we treat thebody as though it were ourself. Intellectually we may do so also. Ourcircumstances and moods may change, but the body appears stable. The body isthe location point of the senses; we look at the world from the vantage pointof the body, and we perceive the objects of our senses to be related spatiallyto our body. Though the mind may wander, sleeping or daydreaming, we count onreturning to the same body. 

Yet do we really thinkof the body as the same as the self? As upset as we might be at the loss of afinger (or any other body part), we would not feel that we had thereby lost ouridentity. In fact, even in normal circumstances, the entire makeup of the bodychanges rapidly, as seen by the turnover of one’s cells. Let us take a briefphilosophical excursion on this point. 

We might ask, “What do the cells that make up my body now have incommon with the cells that will make up my body in, say, seven years?” And, ofcourse, the question contains its own answer: what they have in common is thatthey both make up my body and therefore make up some kind of pattern throughtime that is supposedly my self. But we still don’t know what that pattern quathe self is; we have simply gone round in a circle. 

Philosophers willrecognize this little vignette as a variation on the example of the ship ofTheseus, which, every so often, has all of its planks replaced. The questionis, Is it the same ship or not? And philosophers, being more sophisticated thanmost of the rest of us, deftly reply that there really isn’t any fact of thematter one way or the other. It all depends on what you want to say. In onesense, yes, it is the same ship, and in another sense, no, it isn’t the sameship. It all depends on what your criteria of identity are. For something to bethe same (to have some kind of invariant pattern or form) it must suffer somechange, for otherwise one would not be able to recognize that it had stayed thesame. Conversely, for something to change there must also be some kind ofimplicit permanance that acts as a reference point in judging that a change hasoccurred. So the answer to the quandary is both yes and no, and the details ofany specific yes or no answer will depend on one’s criteria of identity in thegiven situation.[10](#10_9) 

But surely the self—my self—can’t depend on how someone chooses to look at it;it is, after all, a self in its own right. Perhaps, then, the ego-self is theowner of the body, of this form that can be seen in so many ways. Indeed, we donot say “I am a body” but “I have a body.” But justwhat is it that I have? This body, which I seem to own, is also the home fornumerous microorganisms. Do I own them? A strange idea, since often they seemto get the best of me. But who is it that they get the best of? 

Perhaps the mostdefinitive argument that we do not take our body as our self is that we canimagine a total body transplant, that is, the implantation of our mind insomeone else’s body (a favorite theme in science fiction), yet we would stillcount as ourselves. Perhaps, then, we should leave the material and look to themental aggregates for the basis of the self. 

### Feelings/Sensations

All experiences havesome kind of feeling tone, classifiable as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral,and as either bodily feeling or mental feeling. We are very concerned about ourfeelings. We strive endlessly to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Our feelings arecertainly self-relevant, and at moments of strong feeling we take ourselves asour feelings. Yet are they our self? Feelings change from moment to moment.(Awareness of these changes can be made even more precise inmindfulness/awareness practice: one develops firsthand experience of themomentary arising of feelings and sensations as well as their changes.) Thoughfeelings affect the self, no one would say that these feelings are the self. But what/who is it, then, that feelings areaffecting? 

### Perceptions/Impulses

This aggregate refers tothe first moment of recognition, identification, or discernment in the arisingof something distinct, coupled with the activation of a basic impulse foraction toward the discerned object. 

Within the context ofmindfulness/awareness practice, the coupling of discernment and impulse in amoment of experience is especially important. There are said to be three rootimpulses—passion/desire (toward desirable objects), aggression/anger (towardundesirable objects), and delusion/ignoring (toward neutral objects). Insofaras beings are caught up in habits of ego clinging, physical or mental objectsare discerned, even at the first instant, in relation to the self—either asdesirable, undesirable, or irrelevant to the self—andin that very discernment is the automatic impulse to act in the relevantfashion. These three basic impulses are also called the three poisons becausethey are the beginnings of actions that will lead to further ego grasping. Butwho is this ego who is grasping? 

### DispositionalFormations 

This next aggregaterefers to habitual patterns of thinking, feeling, perceiving, andacting—habitual patterns such as confidence, avarice, laziness, worry, etc.(see appendix B). We are now in the domain of the kinds of phenomena that couldwell be called cognitive in the language of cognitive science or personalitytraits in personality psychology. 

We are certainly heavilyself-invested in our habits and traits—our personality. If someone criticizesour behavior or makes a favorable comment about our personality, we feel thatshe is referring to our self. As in each of the other aggregates, our emotionalresponse indicates that we take this aggregate as our ego-self. But again whenwe contemplate the object of that response, our conviction falls apart. We donot normally identify our habits with our self. Our habits, motives, andemotional tendencies may change considerably over time, but we still feel asense of continuity as if there were a self distinct from these personalitychanges. Where could this sense of continuity come from, if not from a selfthat is the basis of our present personality? 

### Consciousnesses

Consciousness is thelast of the aggregates, and it contains all of the others. (Indeed, each of theaggregates contains those that precede it in the list.) It is the mentalexperience that goes with the other four aggregates; technically it is theexperience that comes from the contact of each sense organ with its object(together with the feeling, impulse, and habit that is aroused). Consciousness,as a technical term vijñana, always refers to thedualistic sense of experience in which there is an experiencer, an objectexperienced, and a relation (or relations) binding them together. 

Let us turn for a momentto the systematic description of consciousness made by one of the Abhidharmaschools (see appendix B). The mental factors are the relations that bind theconsciousness to its object, and at each moment a consciousness is dependent onits momentary mental factors (like the hand and its fingers).[11](#11_6)Note that the second, third, and fourth aggregates are included here as mentalfactors. Five of the mental factors are omnipresent; that is, in every momentof consciousness the mind is bound to its object by all five of these factors.There are contact between the mind and its object; aspecific feeling tone of pleasantness,unpleasantness, or neutrality; a discernment of theobject; an intention toward the object; and attention to the object. The rest of the factors, includingall the dispositions that make up the fourth aggregate, are not always present.Some of these factors can be present together in a given moment (such asconfidence and diligence), others are mutually exclusive (such as alertness anddrowsiness). The combination of mental factors that are present make up thecharacter—the color and taste—of a particular moment of consciousness. 

Is this Abhidharmaanalysis of consciousness a system of intentionality along Husserlian lines?There are similarities in that there is no consciousness without an object ofconsciousness and a relation. (Mind [sems] in the Tibetan tradition is oftendefined as “that which projects itself to other.”) But there are differences.Neither the objects of consciousness nor the mental factors arerepresentations. Most important, consciousness (vijñana) is only one mode ofknowing; prajña does not know by means of a subject/object relationship. Wemight call the simple experiential/psychological observation that consciousexperience takes a subject/object form proto­intentionality.12 Husserl’s theoryis based not only on protointentionality but also on Brentano’s notion ofintentionality as subsequently elaborated by Husserl into a full-fledgedrepresentational theory.[13](#13_5) 

The temporalrelationship between a consciousness and its object was the subject of greatdispute among the Abhidharma schools: some held that the occurrence of theobject and of mind was simultaneous; others, that the object occurred first,followed in the succeeding moment by the mind (first a sight, then the seeing consciousness).A third claim was that mind and object were simultaneous for sight, sound,smell, taste, and touch but that the thinking consciousness took as its objectthe preceding moment of thought. This dispute became integral to philosophicaldebates about what things actually existed. There were also disputes aboutwhich factors to include and how they were to be characterized. 

Despite the atmosphereof debate that surrounded some issues, there was unanimous agreement on themore experientially direct claim that each of the senses (eye, ear, nose,tongue, body, and mind) had a different consciousness (recall Jackendoff)—thatis, at each moment of experience there was a different experiencer as well as adifferent object of experience. And of course there was agreement that noactual self was to be found in consciousness, either in the experiencer, theobject of experience, or the mental factors binding them together. 

In our habitual andunreflective state, of course, we impute continuity of consciousness to all ourexperience—so much so that consciousness always occurs in a “realm,” anapparently cohering total environment with its own complete logic (ofaggression, poverty, etc.).[14](#14_5) But this apparent totality andcontinuity of consciousness masks the discontinuity of momentaryconsciousnesses related to one another by cause and effect. A traditionalmetaphor for this illusory continuity is the lighting of one candle with asecond candle, a third candle from that one, and so on—the flame is passed fromone candle to the next without any material basis being passed on. Taking thissequence as a real continuity, however, we cling tenaciously to thisconsciousness and are terrorized by the possibility of its termination indeath. Yet when mindfulness/awareness reveals the disunity of this experience—asight, a sound, a thought, another thought, and so on—it becomes obvious thatconsciousness as such cannot be taken as that self we so treasure and for whichwe are now searching. 

We seem unable to find aself anywhere in each aggregate when we take them one by one. Perhaps, then,all the aggregates combine in some way to form the self. Is the self the sameas the totality of the aggregates? This idea would be quite attractive if onlywe knew how to make it work. Each aggregate taken singly is transitory andimpermanent; how, then, are we to combine them into something lasting andcoherent? Perhaps the self is an emergent property ofthe aggregates? In fact, many people when pressed to define the self (perhapsin a psychology class) will use the concept of an emergent as a solution.Indeed, given the contemporary scientific interest in the emgerent andself-organizing properties of certain complex aggregates, this idea is evenplausible. At this point, however, the idea is of no help. Such aself-organizing or synergistic mechanism is not evident in experience. Moreimportant, it is not the abstract idea of an emergent self that we cling to sofiercely as our ego; we cling to a “real” ego-self. 

When we recognize thatno such real self is given to us in our experience, we may swing to theopposite extreme, which is to say that the self must be radically differentfrom the aggregates. In the Western tradition, this move is best exemplified inthe Cartesian and Kantian claim that the observed regularity or pattern ofexperience requires that there be an agent or mover behind the pattern. ForDescartes, this mover was the res cogitans, thethinking substance. Kant was more subtle and precise. In his Critique of Pure Reason, he wrote, “Consciousness of selfaccording to the determinations of our state in inner perception is merelyempirical, and always changing. No fixed and abiding self can present itself inthis flux of inner appearances. … [Thus] there must be a condition whichprecedes all experience, and which makes experience itself possible. … Thispure original unchangeable consciousness I shall name transcendentalapperception.”15 Apperception basically means awareness, especiallyawareness of the process of cognition. Kant saw quite clearly that there wasnothing given in this experience of awareness that corresponded to the self,and so he argued that there must be a consciousness that is transcendental,that precedes all experience and makes that experience possible. Kant alsothought that this transcendental awareness is responsible for our sense ofunity and identity through time, thus his full term for the transcendentalground of the everyday self was “the transcendental unity of apperception.” 

Kant’s analysis isbrilliant, but it only heightens the predicament. We are told that there reallyis a self, but we can never know it. Furthermore, this self hardly answers toour emotional convictions: it is not me or my self; it is just the idea of a self in general, of someimpersonal agent or mover behind experience. It is pure, original, andunchangeable; I am impure and transitory. How could such a radically differentself have any relation with my experience? How could it be the condition orground of all of my experiences and yet remain untouched by those experiences?If there truly is such a self, it can be relevant to experience only bypartaking of the world’s fabric of dependency, but to do so would obviouslyviolate its pristine, absolute condition. 

We may present thedifference between the Kantian and the mindfulness/awareness views of self inthe form of a diagram (see [figures 4.1](#fig_001_1)–[4.3](#fig_003_1)). In both the Kantian andthe mindfulness/awareness traditions, there is, as we have seen, a recognitionof the absence of a substantial self in the momentariness of experience ([figure 4.1](#fig_001_1)). The Kantian moveavoids confronting the puzzle of our tendency to believe in a self in the faceof this momentariness by positing a pure, original, and unchangeableconsciousness as a ground—the transcendental ego ([figure 4.2](#fig_002_1)). In themindfulness/awareness tradition, the attitude is to hold the puzzle of thismomentariness vividly in mind by considering that the grasping toward a selfcould occur within any given moment of experience ([figure 4.3](#fig_003_1)).

[Figure 4.2](#fig_002a_1) Postulation of atranscendental self as a ground for the momentariness of experience. 

At this point the readerwill probably become rather irritated and say, “Fine, the self isn’t really alasting and coherent thing; it is just the continuity of the stream ofexperience. It is a process and not a thing. What’sthe big deal?” But remember, we have been looking for a self that answers toour emotional/reactional convictions. At this immediate experiential level, wedo not feel as if the self is merely the stream ofexperience. Indeed, even to call it a stream reveals our grasping after somesense of solidity, for this metaphor implies that experience flowscontinuously. But when we subject this continuity to analysis, we seem able tofind only discontinuous moments of feeling, perception, motivation, andawareness. We could, of course, redefine the self in all sorts of ways to getaround these problems, perhaps even by following contemporary analyticphilosophers who use quite sophisticated logical techniques, such as possibleworld semantics, but none of these new accounts would in any way explain ourbasic reactional behavior and everyday tendencies. 

The point is not whetherwe can redefine the self in some way that makes us comfortable orintellectually satisfied, nor is it to determine whether there really is anabsolute self that is nonetheless inaccessible to us. The point is rather todevelop mindfulness of and insight into our situation as we experience it hereand now. As Tsultrim Gyamtso remarks, “Buddhism is not telling anyone that heshould believe that he has a self or that he does not have a self. It is sayingthat when one looks at the way one suffers and the way one thinks and respondsemotionally to life, it is as if one believed there were a selfthat was lasting, single and independent and yet on closer analysis no suchself can be found. In other words, the aggregates (skandhas)are empty of a self.”[16](#16_5) 

## Momentarinessand the Brain 

Nonmeditating modernreaders may be feeling somewhat frustrated at this point. “But what about thebrain?” they may ask. It is a general trend in our scientific culture to shuntquestions about the mind and consciousness to the brain: if we can assume thefunctioning of the brain to be continuous and unified, then we can assume ourmind to be continuous. We are not talking here about a philosophical assumption(which would be inflammatorily debatable) but about a psychological attitude.Although, strictly speaking, in the Abhidharma context we have already takencare of this question with our discussion of the first aggregate of form, thepossibility of a dialogue about momentariness with neuroscience has been leftcompletely open—is there any evidence for momentariness in the functioning ofthe brain? 

Let us be clear aboutwhat we are investigating. An examination of experience withmindfulness/awareness reveals that one’s experience is discontinuous—a momentof consciousness arises, appears to dwell for an instant, and then vanishes, tobe replaced by the next moment.[17](#17_5) Is this description of experience(the kind of description of actual human experience that we have been askingfor) consonant or not consonant with descriptions that we get fromneuroscience? Notice that we are not talking about a direction of causality.And we are not dependent on neuroscience to validate experience; that would bescientific imperialism. We are simply interested, in as open a way as possible,in what neuroscience has to say about the issue of momentariness. 

There is a literature inneuroscience and psychology that can be referred to as “perceptual framing,”which deals with sensorimotor rhythmicity and parsing. One of the most wellknown phenomena studied in this literature is called “perceptual simultaneity”or “apparent motion.” For example, if two lights are shown successively with aninterval less than a period of 0.1–0.2 seconds, they will be seen assimultaneous, or in apparent simultaneity. If the interval is slightlyincreased, the flashing lights will appear to be in rapid motion. If theinterval is increased further, the appearance of motion becomes distinctlysequential. There are examples of this phenomenon that are quite familiar:advertisment displays often have a row of flashing lights with the last lightshaped as an arrow. One set of lights turns on, and then the next, and thenext, giving one the impression that the lights are jumping from one place tothe other in the direction of the arrow. 

It is well known that the brain has a periodic rhythm of activity,which is detectable in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Since the dominantrhythm for the visual cortex is also about 0.15 seconds, it is natural toassume that there is a relationship between temporal framing and cortical alpharhythm. 

This relationship can betested experimentally.[18](#18_5) [Figure 4.4](#fig_004_1) displays theexperimental design. A subject was taken and fitted with surface electrodes sothat the dominant 0.1 seconds rhythm (the so-called alpha rhythm) could beextracted from the electrical activity in his cortex. That rhythm was then usedto trigger on and off the lights that are depicted in front of the subject. Itis well known that if one puts the on-off timing of those lights within acertain range, the subject will say that the lights are on simultaneously. Anddepending on how much one enlarges the interval, the subject will say eitherthat the lights move from one position to another or are sequential. If theinterstimulus interval (the time between the first light being on and thesecond being on) is less than 50 milliseconds, then the lights are reported assimultaneous. If it is over 100 milliseconds, then the lights are reported assequential. In between these two intervals the lights appear to move. 

![9739_004_fig_004.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image021.png)

[Figure 4.4](#fig_004a_1) Experimental setupto investigate the natural parsing of perceptual events. See text fordescription. From Varela et al., Perceptual framing and cortical alpha rhythm. 

In this experiment,however, the subject was asked how he saw the set of lights at differentmoments of his own cortical rhythm. [Figure 4.5](#fig_005_1)presents some of the results. Of the three bars in [figure 4.5](#fig_005_1), the middle bar represents what the subjectsaw when there was no correlation between his brain rhythm and the lights. Herethe interval between the lights is set so that there is an almost chance levelof seeing them as either simultaneous or in apparent motion. On either side ofthe middle bar, there is a correlation between the perception of the lights andthe cortical rhythm at two of its phases—the positive peak and the negativepeak. If the two lights are started at the negative peak, the subject sees themalmost always as simultaneous. If they are started at the positive peak, thenthe subject sees them in apparent motion. The temporal distance between thelights has not been changed; all that has been changed is the moment at whichthe subject has been presented with the lights. 

![9739_004_fig_005.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image023.png)

[Figure 4.5](#fig_005a_1) Results ofexperiments revealing temporal parsing of perceptual events around 100–150msec. See text for more details. 

Experiments such asthese suggest that there is a natural parsing in the visual frame and that suchframing is at least partially and locally related to the rhythm of one’s brainin the range of duration of about 0.1–0.2 seconds at its minimum. Roughlystated, if the lights are presented at the beginning of the frame, thelikelihood of seeing them occur simultaneously is much greater than if they arepresented toward the end of the frame: when they are presented toward the endof the visual frame, the second light can fall, as it were, in the next frame.Everything that falls within a frame will be treated by the subject as if itwere within one time span, one “now.” 

Such neural parsing isto be expected given the fact that the brain is not a sequence of relaystations from the retina to the muscles. At each level there are strongreciprocal and branching connections, so that the entire network can operateonly by a large amount of cooperative, back-and-forth matching of activity atall levels. Furthermore, it has become evident that neurons in the centralnervous system have a rich diversity of electrical properties based on ionicconductances that endow them with auto­rhythmic oscillatory properties. Thisentire cooperative activity takes a certain time to start and to culminate.Such oscillations/resonances can be seen as timing sensorimotor coordination(among other possible functional roles).[19](#19_5)

In the case at hand, therhythm is closely linked to the reciprocal connections and reverberationsbetween the thalamus and the visual cortex. In fact, there is good evidencethat the activity of a neuron in the thalamus and the cortex of mammals has aunitary time course of about 100 milliseconds following a burst of presynapticinput.[20](#20_5) Furthermore, it is generallyaccepted that the alpha rhythm is the result of synchronized thalamocorticalreverberations and synchronously firing neuronal groups.[21](#21_5)These are but a few indications of the basis of a temporal frame. We will comeback to examine visual perceptual events on the basis of self-organizingnetwork operations in more detail in the next chapter. 

It should be remarkedthat the critical period of about 0.15 seconds seems to be the minimum amountof time it takes for a describable and recognizable percept to arise. Beyondthis minimum, of course, the unitary nature of a more complex conceptualizationcan last much longer—up to about 0.5 seconds. This limit can be revealed in thecomponents of the cortical activity known as event-related potentials. Thebasic idea is, again, to use a stimulus that is time locked and to have asubject wear a set of electrodes so that a large number of samples from itssurface electrical activity can be collected. Theseevent-related potentials (ERPs) are notoriously noisy, as can be expected froma remote sensing of a large body of neurons. But recent methods usingalgorithms that learn to recognize significant correlation have begun to giveimages of these “shadows of thought.”[22](#22_5)

[Figure 4.6a](#fig_006) shows, for example, amontage of fifteen electrodes over the entire head of a subject. In this studythe task was to estimate the distance a target should be moved to estimate adisplayed arrow’s trajectory. The “move” task required pressure on a buttonunder the right finger with a force proportional to that distance. In contrast,in the “no move” task the arrow pointed directly at the target, and no pressingwas required. Thus although the gross stimulus conditions were comparable, thespatial judgments and response differed between the two cases. [Figure 4.6b](#fig_006) displays the ERP forthe two tasks. It is evident that they differ only in the 300–500 msec range,not before or after. Furthermore, as [figure4.6c](#fig_006) shows, the regions of the brain’s mass activity in differentmoments and different tasks are like moving clouds of electrical activity thatappear to shift and subside—an electrical shadow of the momentariness ofexperience. 

![9739_004_fig_006.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image025.png)

This neuropsychologicalperspective is interesting for our purposes because the parsing of experiencenaturally corresponds to the aggregates of the mindfulness/awarenesspractitioner. In fact, the phenomenon of parsing is not evident at first glancefor either the neuropsychologist or the practitioner. But it can be revealedthrough a disciplined method of examining experience, such asmindfulness/awareness. 

It is an interesting question, from the standpoint ofmindfulness/awareness practice, whether the aggregates express a direct observationof components arising sequentially (whether there is a sequence of developmentimplied in listing them individually), or whether they arise simultaneouslyfrom moment to moment (the listing is an inferred decomposition). This issueprovides a classical example of how descriptions might change as a function ofone’s habits of attention and observation, perhaps as a function of thecontextual purpose of the description (who is being taught about the aggregatesand for what reason). The descriptions of some authors do at times seem toindicate that the aggregates are sequential,[23](#c4_note_23)but other descriptions (in particular the more classical texts less concernedwith the question) are not very explicit about the issue at all;[24](#24_3)this makes perfect sense given the function of the description of theaggregates in Buddhist discourse. 

Even when one does takeas an object of inquiry whether the aggregates are sequential or simultaneous,for most people the aggregates appear phenomenologically to arise too rapidlyfor them to tell. In consonance with neurophysiological observations of thebrief timing of a unit of experience, the aggregates seem to arise as apackage. For example, even from an information-processing point of view incontemporary cognitive psychology, form and discernment would appear to specifyeach other. Form can be seen as the arising of something distinct from abackground (a figure from a background), but discernment is not the simpleregistering of the distinction: it is an active (that is, top-down) process ofconceptualization that enables even simple distinctions of form to bediscerned. Neither form nor discernment is simply given beforehand: as we haveseen, we frame our perceptions as intentional items. 

On the other hand, theneurophysiological observations indicate (as shown, for example, in [figure 4.6](#fig_006)) that the initialstages of perceptual organization (at least in these laboratory conditions andfor simple visuomotor patterns) precede the more cognitively related electricalcorrelates by some 100–200 milliseconds. This time difference might just be toofast for detailed attention except when training in attention has stabilizedsufficiently to notice the difference. Even so, it is quite remarkable thatsuch fine points of observation could be made, presented, and repeatedlyvalidated by practitioners centuries apart, in terms that make the comparisonwith neuropsychological evidence quite possible and intriguing. 

Furthermore, what isavailable to an experienced meditator is not necessarily available to abeginner. In particular, this example of the analysis of the aggregateshighlights the process of change that one’s awareness/attention undergoes inthe open-ended stance proposed by mindfulness/awareness. As we outlined inchapter 2, the foundation of mindfulness/awareness practice is the cultivationof mindfulness through a relaxed focusing on the arising of every moment ofexperience, whether during sitting periods (the “laboratory” situation ofmindfulness/awareness) or in daily life. By paying attention over and overagain to the details of our embodied situation, awareness of what happensbecomes more and more spontaneous. What at the beginning are simply mereflickers of a thought or an emotion become sharper and more apparent in thedetails of their arising. Through further development, the attention paid tomental movements is sufficiently subtle and quick that mindfulness actually hasto be dropped as a distinct attitude. At this point, mindfulness is eitherspontaneously present or it is not. Then as this inseparability betweenawareness and mental movement stabilizes further, observations of the fineprogression of the aggregates (whether sequential or simultaneous) from momentto moment become possible. 

This progression ofattention has received even further and more detailed consideration in theBuddhist tradition, but we have presented enough of its basic development forour purposes here. We can now bring this chapter to a close by returning to thetheme with which we began: the nature of the ego-self. 

## The Aggregates without a Self 

It might appear that inour search for a self in the aggregates we have come out empty handed.Everything that we tried to grasp seemed to slip through our fingers, leavingus with the sense that there is nothing to hold on to. At this point, it isimportant to pause and again remind ourselves of just what it was that we wereunable to find. 

We did not fail to findthe physical body, though we had to admit that its designation as my body depends very much on how we choose to look atthings. Nor did we fail to locate our feelings or sensations, and we also foundour various perceptions. We found dispositions, volitions, motivations—inshort, all those things that make up our personality and emotional sense ofself. We also found all the various forms in which we can be aware—awareness ofseeing and hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, even awareness of our ownthought processes. So the only thing we didn’t find was a truly existing selfor ego. But notice that we did find experience. Indeed, we entered the very eyeof the storm of experience, we just simply could discern there no self, no “I.”

Why then do we feelempty handed? We feel this way because we tried to grasp something that wasnever there in the first place. This grasping goes on all the time; it is exactlythe deep-rooted emotional response that conditions all of our behavior andshapes all of the situations in which we live. It is for this reason that thefive aggregates are glossed as the “aggregates of grasping” (upadanaskandha). We—that is, our personality, which islargely dispositional formations—cling to the aggregates as if they were theself when, in fact, they are empty (sunya) of a self.And yet despite this emptiness of ego-self, the aggregates are full ofexperience. How is this possible? 

The progressivedevelopment of insight enhances the experience of calm mindfulness and expandsthe space within which all experiential arisings occur. As this practicedevelops, one’s immediate attitude (not simply one’s after-the-factreflections) becomes more and more focused on the awareness that theseexperiences—thoughts, dispositions, perceptions, feelings, andsensations—cannot be pinned down. Our habitual clinging to them is itself onlyanother feeling, another disposition of our mind. 

This arising andsubsiding, emergence and decay, is just that emptiness of self in theaggregates of experience. In other words, the very fact that the aggregates arefull of experience is the same as the fact that they are empty of self. Ifthere were a solid, really existing self hidden in or behind the aggregates,its unchangeableness would prevent any experience from occurring; its staticnature would make the constant arising and subsiding of experience come to ascreeching halt. (It is not surprising, therefore, that techniques ofmeditation that presuppose the existence of such a self proceed by closing offthe senses and denying the world of experience.) But that circle of arising anddecay of experience turns continuously, and it can do so only because it is emptyof a self. 

In this chapter we haveseen not only that cognition and experience do not appear to have a trulyexisting self but also that the habitual belief in such an ego-self, thecontinual grasping to such a self, is the basis of the origin and continuationof human suffering and habitual patterns. In our culture, science hascontributed to the awakening of this sense of the lack of a fixed self but hasonly described it from afar. Science has shown us that a fixed self is notnecessary for mind but has not provided any way of dealing with the basic factthat this no-longer-needed self is precisely the ego-self that everyone clingsto and holds most dear. By remaining at the level of description, science hasyet to awaken to the idea that the experience of mind, not merely without someimpersonal, hypothetical, and theoretically constructed self but withoutego-self, can be profoundly transformative. 

Perhaps it is not fair to ask more of science. To borrow the words ofMerleau-Ponty, the strength of science may lie precisely in the fact that itgives up living among things, preferring to manipulate them instead.[25](#25_3) But if this preference expressesthe strength of science, it also indicates its weakness. By renouncing a lifeamid the things of experience, the scientist is able to remain relativelyunaffected by her discoveries.[26](#26_3) This situation has, perhaps, beentolerable for the past three hundred years, but it is fast becoming intolerablein our modern era of cognitive science. 

If science is tocontinue to maintain its position of de facto authority in a responsible andenlightened manner, then it must enlarge its horizon to include mindful, open-endedanalyses of experience, such as the one evoked here. Cognitivism, at least atthe moment, does not seem to be capable of such a step, given its narrowconception of cognition as the computation of symbols after the fashion ofdeductive logic. It would do well to remember, then, that cognitivism did notemerge ready made, like Athena from the head of Zeus. Only a few of itsexponents are sensitive to its roots in its earlier years and to the decisionsthat were subsequently made about which avenues of research to explore. Theseearlier years, however, have once more become a source of inspiration to a newand controversial approach to cognition in which the self-organizing qualitiesof biological aggregates play a central role. This approach sheds new light onall of the themes we have touched so far and takes us into part III of ourexploration.

See appendixes A, B,and C, and Narada, A Manual of Abhidhamma (Abhidammattha Sangaha); Buddhaghosa, ThePath of Purification (Visuddhimagga); Vasubandhu, L’Abhidharmakosade Vasubandhu; Trungpa, Glimpses of Abhidharma;Kalu, The Dharma.

[6.](#6_8) It is often said that in Buddhist “philosophy” thereis little interest in “ontology” or that ontology and epistemology are “notdistinguished.” This somewhat misses the point about what Buddhism isattempting to do and its orientation toward immediate, everyday experience.From the Buddhist point of view, ontology is simply a very strange category.

[7.](#7_8) Translations of these terms unfortunately varyconsiderably. The Sanscrit terms are rupa, vedana, samjna, samskara, and vijnana. The thirdand fourth terms are particularly difficult to translate. Thus samjna, for which we use “perception(discernment)/impulse,”has also been translated as “conceptualization,” “discernment,”“discrimination,” “perception,” and “recognition.” Samskarais even more problematic, having been rendered as “compositional factors,”“dispositions,” “emotional creations,” “formations,” “mental constructions,”“motivations,” and “volitions.” Since the basic idea behind this category isthat of the mental tendencies that are formative of one’s experiences, we havecoined the term “dispositional formations.”

[8.](#8_7) Kalupahana, Principles of BuddhistPsychology, presents an interesting but idiosyncratic account of thepsychophysical complex (nama-rupa) as the basiccategory of the Abhidharma. Both sides of the complex, the physical as well asthe psychological, are defined in terms of experience: the basic experientialoperation that defines the psychological is contact with concepts; that which definesthe physical is contact with resistance (the meaningof contact in the Abhidharma will be discussed inchapter 6). Phenomenologists might say that the nature of each of these is distinction, that is, the emergence of somethingdistinguishable from a background: in the physical modality, distinctions basedon sensory resistance, in the psychological modality, distinctions based onconcepts.

[17.](#17_4) One might think to reverse the figure and ground ofone’s investigations and ask whether there are not gaps as well asdiscontinuities between the moments of arising of consciousness. This questiontouches a crucial difference among Buddhist schools. According to the TheravadaAbhidhamma, thought moments are contiguous, even between one lifetime and thenext. At the other extreme, there are schools which teach that there can be anabsolute gap in the habitual thought process in which one can experience fullyawakened mind. The research that we are about to describe can certainly not lay claim to relevance for that issue. In the Buddhistliterature there are also mentions of the actual moments of time that it takesto switch from one moment to the next, which range anywhere from 13 to 100milliseconds; see E Conze, Buddhist Thought in India,282; this matter is also discussed by Hayward, ShiftingWorlds, Changing Minds, chapter 12.

[III ]()Varieties ofEmergence 

# [5 ]()Emergent Properties and Connectionism 

## Self-Organization: The Roots of an Alternative 

We now embark on thesecond stage of our exploration of the dialogue between cognitive science andthe examination of human experience through the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation. In the first stage we saw how the notion ofthe cognitive agent as a bundle of representations plays a central role in bothpresent-day cognitivism and in the initial stages of the mindful, open-endedexamination of experience. In this second stage the dominant theme shifts tothe notion of emergent properties. This key notionhas a complex history, which provides the entry point for our presentation. 

Alternatives to thedominant approach of symbol manipulation in cognitive science were alreadyproposed and widely discussed during the early, formative years of cybernetics.At the Macy Conferences,[1](#1_11) for example, extensive discussionoccurred concerning the point that in actual brains there seem to be no rules,no central logical processor, nor does information appear to be stored inprecise addresses. Rather, brains can be seen to operate on the basis ofmassive interconnections in a distributed form, so that the actual connectionsamong ensembles of neurons change as a result of experience. In brief, theseensembles present us with a self-organizing capacity that is nowhere to befound in the paradigm for symbol manipulation. In 1958 Frank Rosenblatt builtthe “Perceptron,” a simple device with some capacity for recognition, purely onthe basis of the changes of connectivity among neuronlike components;[2](#2_11) similarly, W. R. Ashby did thefirst study of the dynamics of very large systems with random interconnections,showing that they exhibit coherent global behaviors.[3](#3_11)

The standard historywould have it that these alternative views were literally wiped out of theintellectual scene in favor of the computational ideas discussed in chapter 3.It was only in the late 1970s that an explosive rekindling of these ideas tookplace—after twenty-five years of dominance of the cognitivist orthodoxy (whatDaniel Dennett has amusingly termed “High Church Computationalism”).[4](#4_11) Certainly one of the contributingfactors in this renewed interest was the parallel rediscovery ofself-organizational ideas in physics and nonlinear mathematics, as well as theeasy access to fast computers. 

The recent motivation totake a second look into self-organization was based on two widely acknowledgeddeficiencies of cognitivism. The first is that symbolic information processingis based on sequential rules, applied one at a time.This “von Neumann bottleneck” is a dramatic limitation when the task at handrequires large numbers of sequential operations (such as image analysis orweather forecasting). A continued search for parallelprocessing algorithms has met with little success because the entirecomputational orthodoxy seems to run precisely counter to it. 

A second importantlimitation is that symbolic processing is localized: the loss or malfunction ofany part of the symbols or rules of the system results in a seriousmalfunction. In contrast, a distributed operation ishighly desirable, so that there is at least a relative equipotentiality andimmunity to mutilations. 

The culmination of experience in the first two decades of thecognitivist dominance can best be expressed by noting a conviction that grewgradually among the community of researchers: it is necessary to invert theexpert and the child in the scale of performances. The first attempts weredirected at solving the most general problems, such as natural languagetranslation or the problem of devising a “general problem solver.” Theseattempts, which tried to match the intelligence of a person who is a highlytrained expert, were seen as tackling the interesting, hard issues. As theattempts became more modest and local, it became apparent that the deeper andmore fundamental kind of intelligence is that of a baby who can acquirelanguage from dispersed daily utterances and can constitute meaningful objectsfrom what seems to be a sea of lights. Cognitivist architectures had moved toofar from biological inspirations; one does not wish to reduce the cognitive tothe biological, but the most ordinary tasks are done faster when performed evenby tiny insects than is possible when they are attempted with a computationalstrategy of the type proposed in the cognitivist orthodoxy. Similarly, theresiliency of the brain to resist damage, or the flexibility of biologicalcognition to adjust to new environments without compromising all of itscompetence, is taken for granted by neurobiologists but is nowhere to be seenin the computational paradigm. 

## TheConnectionist Strategy 

In this alternativeorientation in cognitive science, then, the brain has once more become the mainsource of metaphors and ideas. Theories and models no longer begin withabstract symbolic descriptions but with a whole army of neurallike, simple,unintelligent components, which, when appropriately connected, have interestingglobal properties. These global properties embody and express the cognitivecapacities being sought. 

The entire approachdepends, then, on introducing the appropriate connections, which is usuallydone through a rule for the gradual change of connections starting from afairly arbitrary initial state. The most thoroughly explored learning rule is“Hebb’s Rule.” In 1949 Donald Hebb suggested that learning could be based inchanges in the brain that stem from the degree of correlated activity betweenneurons: if two neurons tend to be active together, their connection isstrengthened; otherwise it is diminished. Therefore, the system’s connectivity becomesinseparable from its history of transformation and related to the kind of taskdefined for the system. Since the real action happens at the level of theconnections, the name connectionism (often called neoconnectionism) has beenproposed for this direction of research.[5](#5_11)

One of the importantfactors contributing to the explosive interest in this approach today was theintroduction of some effective methods of following the changes that can occurin these networks. Great attention has been given to the introduction ofstatistical measures that provide the system with a global energy function thatpermits one to follow how the system arrives into convergent states.[6](#6_11) 

Let us consider anexample. Take a total number (say N) of simpleneuronlike elements and connect them reciprocally. Next present this systemwith a succession of patterns by treating some of its nodes as sensory ends (aretina if you wish). After each presentation let the system reorganize itselfby rearranging its connections following a Hebbian principle, that is, byincreasing the links between those neurons that happen to be active togetherfor the item presented. The presentation of an entire list of patternsconstitutes the system’s learning phase. 

After the learningphase, when the system is presented again with one of these patterns, itrecognizes it, in the sense that it falls into a unique global state orinternal configuration that is said to represent the learned item. Thisrecognition is possible provided the number of patterns presented is not largerthan a fraction of the total number of participating neurons (about 0.15 N). Furthermore, the systemperforms a correct recognition even if the pattern is presented with addednoise or the system is partially mutilated.[7](#7_11)

## Emergenceand Self-Organization 

This example is but oneof a whole class of neural network or connectionist models, which we shalldiscuss further. But first we need to broaden the discussion to understand whatis at stake in studying these networks. The strategy, as we said, is to build acognitive system not by starting with symbols and rules but by starting withsimple components that would dynamically connect to each other in dense ways.In this approach, each component operates only in its local environment, sothat there is no external agent that, as it were, turns the system’s axle. Butbecause of the system’s network constitution, there is a global cooperationthat spontaneously emerges when the states of all participating “neurons” reacha mutually satisfactory state. In such a system, then, there is no need for acentral processing unit to guide the entire operation.[8](#c5_note_8)This passage from local rules to global coherence is the heart of what used tobe called self-organization during the cybernetic years.[9](#9_11)Today people prefer to speak of emergent or global properties, networkdynamics, nonlinear networks, complex systems, or even synergetics. 

There is no unifiedformal theory of emergent properties. It is clear, however, that emergentproperties have been found across all domains—vortices and lasers, chemicaloscillations, genetic networks, developmental patterns, population genetics,immune networks, ecology, and geophysics. What all these diverse phenomena havein common is that in each case a network gives rise to new properties, whichresearchers try to understand in all their generality.[10](#10_11) One of the most useful ways ofcapturing the emergent properties that these various systems have in common isthrough the notion of an “attractor” in dynamical systems theory. Since thisidea will be of importance for the rest of our discussion, let us pause toconsider it through an example.[11](#11_8) 

Consider a cellular automata, a simple unit that receives inputs fromtwo immediate neighbors and communicates its internal state to the sameimmediate neighbors. Assume that the cell or unit can be in only two states (0or 1, active or inactive) and that the rule governing the change in eachautomata is simply a (Boolean) function of two arguments (such as “and” or“exclusive or”). Since we can choose such a function for each one of the twostates of the cellular automata, the operation of each unit is completelyspecified by a pair of Boolean functions. 

Instead of working witha complex network, we simply connect a string of such elementary units into acircular array, so that there is no input and output from the entire ring, onlyinternal actions. For the purpose of display, however, it is easier to cut thisring open and to present it linearly, with the cells in the 1 state indicatedby a black square and those in the opposite state indicated by a blank space.Accordingly, in the display in [figure 5.1](#fig_001_2), the cellular position runs from left toright (with the last cell linked to the first one, according to the chosen ringarchitecture).

[Figure 5.1](#fig_001a_2) Constructing asimple cellular automaton. 

This ring of cellularautomata acquires a dynamics by starting at some random state and letting eachcell reach an updated state at each (discrete) moment of time in a synchronousfashion (i.e., all of the cells reach their respective states together). In thedisplay, we represent the initial instant at the topmost row and successiveinstants of time going downward. Thus the successive states of the same cellcan be read as a column, and the simultaneous states of all cells can be readas a row. In all the simulations presented in [figure 5.2](#fig_002_2), the ring wascomposed of eighty cells, and its initial starting state was chosen at random.

[Figure 5.2](#fig_002a_2) Emergentcooperative patterns (or “attractors”) in cellular automata. 

It is remarkable toobserve that even this simple, almost minimal network has rich self-organizingcapacities. A thorough examination of its capacities has been conductedrecently by S. Wolfram.[12](#12_6) We will not recapitulate his workhere. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that dynamically these ringsfall into four major classes or attractors, as illustrated in [figure 5.2](#fig_002_2). A first classexhibits a simple attractor, which leads all cells to become homogenouslyactive or inactive. For a second, more interesting class of rings the rulesgive rise to spatial periodicities, that is, some cells remain active whileothers do not. For a third class the rules give rise to spatiotemporal cyclesof length two or longer. These last two classes correspond to cyclicattractors. Finally, for a few rules the dynamics seem to give rise to chaoticattractors, where one does not detect any regularities in space or time. 

The basic point we areillustrating here is that the emergence of global patterns or configurations insystems of interacting elements is neither an oddity of isolated cases norunique to neural systems. In fact, it seems difficult for any densely connectedaggregate to escape emergent properties; thus theories of such properties are anatural link for different levels of descriptions in natural and cognitivephenomena. With this larger view of self-organization in mind, let us return nowto neural networks and connectionism. 

## ConnectionismToday 

Connectionist theoriesprovide, with amazing grace, working models for a number of interestingcognitive capacities, such as rapid recognition, associative memory, andcategorical generalization. The current enthusiasm for this orientation isjustified on several counts. First, cognitivist AI and neuroscience had fewconvincing results to account for (or reconstruct) the kinds of cognitiveprocesses introduced above. Second, connectionist models are much closer tobiological systems; thus one can work with a degree of integration between AIand neuroscience that was hitherto unthinkable. Third, in experimentalpsychology connectionist models facilitate a return to a behavioristorientation, which circumvents theorizing in terms of high-level, commonsense, mentalisticconstructs (a style of theory that had been legitimated by cognitivism butabout which psychology remained ambivalent). Finally, the models are generalenough to be applied, with little modification, to various domains, such asvision or speech recognition. 

There is a variety ofexamples of emergent neural states for tasks that require no learning, such aseye movements or ballistic limb movements. Obviously, most of the cognitivetasks one wishes to understand involve experience-dependent transformations,hence the interest in learning rules such as Hebb’s, which we introduced in ourfirst example. Such rules provide a neural network not just with emergentconfigurations (as was the case even for our simple ring automaton) but withthe capacity to synthesize new configurations according to experience. 

We are not going toreview here this developing field of research into plastic neural networks andtheir applications to the study of the brain and artificial intelligence.[13](#13_7) It is sufficient for our purposesto point out that there are two major classes of learning methods currentlybeing explored. The first one, illustrated by Hebb’s rule and inspired by brainmechanisms, is learning by correlation: the system ispresented with a whole series of examples and is molded by it for futureencounters. The second alternative is learning by copying,that is, by having a model that acts as an active instructor. This strategy is,in fact, the one proposed early on by Rosenblatt in his Perceptron. In itsmodern version it is known as “backpropagation.” In this technique, changes inthe neuronal connections inside the network (called “hidden units”) areassigned so as to minimize the difference between the network’s response andwhat is expected of it.[14](#14_7) Here learning resembles someonetrying to imitate an instructor. NetTalk, a celebrated recent example of thismethod, is a grapheme-­phoneme conversion machine that works by being shown afew pages of an English text in its learning phase. As a result, NetTalk canread aloud a new text in what many listeners consider deficient butcomprehensible English.[15](#15_6) 

## NeuronalEmergences 

Recent work has producedsome detailed evidence that emergent properties are fundamental to theoperation of the brain itself. This point is hardly surprising if one looks atthe details of the brain’s anatomy. In fact, since the time of Sherrington andPavlov the understanding of global distributed properties has been an El Doradoof neuroscience, one that is difficult to reach. The reasons for thesedifficulties have been both technical and conceptual. They have been technicalbecause it is not easy to know what myriad neurons dispersed over the brain aresimultaneously doing. Only recently have some of the methods become trulyeffective.[16](#16_7) But the difficulties have alsobeen conceptual, for neuroscientists had a strong preference during the 60s and70s for looking at the brain through cognitivist glasses. Thusinformation-processing metaphors based on the belief that the brain can bedescribed as a von Neumann computer were more in vogue than emergent networkdescriptions. 

Information-processingmetaphors are, however, of limited use. For example, although neurons in thevisual cortex do have distinct responses to specific features of the visualstimuli, these responses occur only in an anesthetized animal with a highlysimplified internal and external environment. When more normal sensorysurroundings are allowed and the animal is studied awake and behaving, it hasbecome increasingly clear that stereotyped neuronal responses become highlycontext sensitive. There are, for example, distinct effects produced by bodilytilt or auditory stimulation.[17](#17_7) Furthermore, the neuronalresponse characteristics depend directly on neurons localized far from theirreceptive fields.[18](#18_7) Even a change in posture, whilepreserving the same identical sensorial stimulation, alters the neuronalresponses in the primary visual cortex, demonstrating that even the seeminglyremote motorium is in resonance with the sensorium.[19](#19_7)A symbolic, stage-by-stage description for a system with this type ofconstitution seems to go against the grain. 

It has, therefore,become increasingly clear to neuroscientists that one needs to study neurons asmembers of large ensembles that are constantly disappearing and arising throughtheir cooperative interactions and in which every neuron has multiple andchanging responses in a context-dependent manner. A rule for the constitutionof the brain is that if a region (nucleus, layer) Aconnects to B, then Bconnects reciprocally back to A. This law ofreciprocity has only two or three minor exceptions. The brain is thus a highlycooperative system: the dense interconnections among its components entail thateventually everything going on will be a function of what all the componentsare doing. 

This kind ofcooperativeness holds both locally and globally: it functions within subsystemsof the brain and at the level of the connections among those subsystems. Onecan take the entire brain and divide it into subsections, depending on thekinds of cells and areas, such as the thalamus, hypocampus, cortical gyri, etc.These subsections are made up of complex networks of cells, but they alsorelate to each other in a network fashion. As a result the entire systemacquires an internal coherence in intricate patterns, even if we cannot sayexactly how this occurs. For example, if one artificially mobilizes thereticular system, an organism will change behaviorally from, say, being awaketo being asleep. This change does not indicate, however, that the reticularsystem is the controller of wakefulness. That system is, rather, a form ofarchitecture in the brain that permits certain internal coherences to arise.But when these coherences arise, they are not simply due to any particularsystem. The reticular system is necessary but not sufficient for certaincoherent states, such as wakefulness and sleep. It is the animal that is asleepor awake, not the reticular neurons. In fact, there are many levels ofresolution at which such neuronal emergences can be studied, from the level ofcellular properties to entire brain regions, each level of detail requiring adifferent methodology.[20](#20_7) 

Consider what happens in visual perception in its peripheral stages.The first diagram in [figure 5.3](#fig_003_2) displays the visual pathways of the brain.The optic nerve connects from the eyes to a region in the thalamus called thelateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from there to the visual cortex. Thestandard information-processing description (still found in textbooks and popularaccounts) is that information enters through the eyes and is relayedsequentially through the thalamus to the cortex where “further processing” iscarried out. But if one looks closely at the way the whole system is puttogether, one finds little to support this view of sequentiality. The seconddiagram in [figure 5.3](#fig_003_2)depicts the way the LGN is embedded in the brain network. It is evident that 80percent of what any LGN cell listens to comes not from the retina but from the denseinterconnectedness of other regions of the brain. Furthermore, one can see thatthere are more fibers coming from the cortex down to the LGN than there aregoing in the reverse direction. To look at the visual pathways as constitutinga sequential processer seems entirely arbitrary; one could just as easily seethe sequence moving in the reverse direction. 

![9739_005_fig_003.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image031.png)

[Figure 5.3](#fig_003a_2) Connections in thevisual pathway of mammals at the thalamic level. 

Thus even at the most peripheralend of the visual system, the influences that the brain receives from the eyeare met by more activity that flows out from the cortex. The encounter of thesetwo ensembles of neuronal activity is one moment in the emergence of a newcoherent configuration, depending on a sort of resonance or activematch-mismatch between the sensory activity and the internal setting at theprimary cortex.[21](#21_7) The primary visual cortex is,however, but one of the partners in this particular neuronal local circuit atthe LGN level. Other partners, such as the reticular formation, the fiberscoming from the superior colliculus, or the corollary discharge of neurons thatcontrol eye movements, play an equally active role.[22](#22_7)Thus the behavior of the whole system resembles a cocktail party conversationmuch more than a chain of command. 

What we have describedfor the LGN and vision is, of course, a uniform principle throughout the brain.Vision is useful as a case study since the details are better known than formost other nuclei and cortical areas. An individual neuron participates in manysuch global patterns and bears little significance when taken individually. Inthis sense, the basic mechanism of recognition of a visual object or a visualattribute could be said to be the emergence of a global state among resonating neuronal ensembles. 

In fact, StephenGrossberg has pioneered a detailed analysis of such adaptive resonant neuronalnetworks;[23](#23_6) the skeleton of one known as ART(from adaptive resonance theory) is shown in [figure 5.4](#fig_004_2). These models are interesting because they match theoverall architecture in the visual pathways that we have just outlined, whileat the same time they are mathematically precise, thus permitting simulationsand artificial implementation. ART is capable of self-organizing,self-stabilizing, and self-scaling a recognition “code” (a set of stabilizedinternal configurations) in response to arbitrary sequences of arbitrarily manyinput patterns. The core of ART is two successive stages (labeled F1 and F2 in [figure 5.4](#fig_004_2) andreminiscent of the LGN and visual cortex) that respond to activation patternsin short-term memory (STM). This bottom-up stream meets a bottom-down streamthrough the activation of long-term memory (LTM) traces. The rest of ARTmodulates STM and LTM processes, such as grain control and wave resetting.Carpenter and Grossberg find that during the self-organizing phase“attentional” mechanisms are critical for learning; these mechanisms appearwhen there is mismatch between bottom-up and top-down patterns. These resonantnetworks have been shown to be capable of rapidly learning to categorizevarious streams of input, such as letters into classes, without a predefinedlist. All the rules in ART describe emergent properties of parallel networkinteractions.

At this point we wouldlike to return to the topic of emergent biological processes and the fiveaggregates discussed in the previous chapter. We raised the issue there ofwhether the aggregates arise sequentially or simultaneously. Within thetraditional Buddhist texts, this issue rarely arises, largely because theaggregates do not constitute an information-processing theory; they functionrather as a psychological and phenomenological description of ego-mind (ofego-oriented experience) and as a set of categories to be used in firsthandexamination of that experience of ego-mind. For us, however, the issue is worthpursuing, since concern with the parsing of experience is one of the moreremarkable points of convergence between cognitive science and themindfulness/awareness tradition. To take a sequential view of the aggregatesseems similar to taking a sequential view of brain activity. Form would have tocome first through some preattentive segmentation at the retinal and geniculatelevel, then sensations and perceptions would arise at the reticular andcollicular input, whereas concepts and consciousness would be added atdifferent stages of “higher” brain centers, in areas such as V4, MT, or theinferotemporal cortex. If, however, perceptual activity cannot be so simplyanalyzed into a straightforward sequence, then it becomes difficult to separatethe “low” level of form from the “higher” levels of, say, sensations anddiscernments. The arising of form always involves some predisposition on thepart of our structure. If we take the notion of a heap or pile (skandha) as a metaphor for the emergent configurations of aneural network, we will be led to think of the aggregates as resonant patternsin one moment of emergence. Such resonant patterns do take time to arise, since they involve many cycles of back-and-forthactivity among all participating local networks. In the last chapter wediscussed in some detail how this momentary arising of patterns is perceptuallyand electrically observable in a temporal frame. Furthermore, we also discussedhow, following a certain degree of proficiency in the capacity to observe sucharising, even the finer temporal details are discernible. The “chunkiness” ofsuch transitory configurations seems to be an inevitable consequence of theemergent properties of a network such as the brain. 

It is possible, then, tosee the notion of a heap or pile as a metaphor for what we would now call aself-organizing process. The aggregates would arise as one moment of emergence,as in a resonating network where strictly speaking there is no all-or-noneseparation between simultaneous (since the emergent pattern itself arises as awhole) and sequential (since for the pattern to arise there must be aback-and-forth activity between participating components). Of course, as wesaid above, the aggregates do not constitute an information-processing theory.Nonetheless, the neuropsychological approach that we have just adumbrated seemscompatible with the direct observations based on mindfulness/awarenessmeditation, thus making all the more remarkable the fact that this traditionhas continued to verify the parsing of experience into coherent moments ofemergence. 

## Exeuntthe Symbols 

This alternativeorientation—connectionist, emergent, self-organizational, associationist,network dynamical—is young and diverse. Most of those who would enlistthemselves as members hold widely divergent views on what cognitive science isand on its future. Keeping this disclaimer in mind, we can now present answersto the questions we previously posed to cognitivism from this perspective: 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

The emergence of global states in a network of simple components. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through local rules for individual operation and rules for changes inthe connectivity among the elements. 

 

Question 3: 

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

Answer: 

When the emergent properties (and resulting structure) can be seen tocorrespond to a specific cognitive capacity—a successful solution to a requiredtask. 

One of the most interesting aspects of this alternative approach incognitive science is that symbols, in their conventional sense, play no role.In the connectionist approach, symbolic computations are replaced by numericaloperations—for example, the differential equations that govern a dynamicalsystem. These operations are more fine grained than those performed usingsymbols; in other words, a single, discrete symbolic computation would, in aconnectionist model, be performed as a result of a large number of numericaloperations that govern a network of simple units. In such a system, themeaningful items are not symbols; they are complex patterns of activity amongthe numerous units that make up the network. 

This nonsymbolicapproach involves a radical departure from the basic cognitivist assumptionthat there must be a distinct symbolic level in the explanation of cognition.Cognitivism introduced symbols as a way of bridging the need for a semantic orrepresentational level with the constraint that this level be ultimatelyphysical. Symbols are both meaningful and physical, and a computer is a devicethat respects the meaning of the symbols while operating only on their physicalform. This separation between form and meaning was the masterstroke thatcreated the cognitivist approach—indeed, it was the same one that had createdmodern logic. But this fundamental move also implies a weakness in addressingcognitive phenomena at a deeper level: How do the symbols acquire theirmeaning? 

In situations where theuniverse of possible items to be represented is constrained and clear-cut (forexample, when a computer is programmed or when an experiment is conducted witha set of predefined visual stimuli), the assignment of meaning is clear. Eachdiscrete physical or functional item is made to correspond to an external item(its referential meaning), a mapping operation that the observer easilyprovides. Remove these constraints, and the form of the symbols is all that isleft, and meaning becomes a ghost, as it would if we were to contemplate thebit patterns in a computer whose operating manual had been lost. 

In the connectionistapproach, however, meaning is not located in particular symbols; it is afunction of the global state of the system and is linked to the overallperformance in some domain, such as recognition or learning. Since this globalstate emerges from a network of units that are more fine grained than symbols,some researchers refer to connectionism as the “subsymbolic paradigm.”[24](#24_5) They argue that the formalprinciples of cognition lie in this subsymbolic domain, a domain above butcloser to the biological than to the symbolic level of cognitivism. At thesubsymbolic level, cognitive descriptions are built out of the constituents ofwhat at a higher level would be discrete symbols. Meaning, however, does notreside in these constituents per se; it resides in complex patterns of activitythat emerge from the interactions of many such constituents. 

## LinkingSymbols and Emergence 

This difference betweensubsymbolic and symbolic brings us back to our question about the relationbetween various levels of explanation in the study of cognition. How mightsubsymbolic emergence and symbolic computation be related? 

The most obvious answeris that these two views should be seen as complementary bottom-up and top-downapproaches or that they could be pragmatically joined in some mixed mode orsimply used at different levels or stages. A typical example of this move wouldbe to describe early vision in connectionist terms, up to, say, the primaryvisual cortex. Then, at the level of the inferotemporal cortex, the descriptionwould be based on symbolic programs. The conceptual status of such a synthesis,however, is far from clear, and concrete examples are still lacking. 

In our view, the most interesting relation between subsymbolicemergence and symbolic computation is one of inclusion,in which we see symbols as a higher-level description of properties that areultimately embedded in an underlying distributed system. The case of theso-called genetic code is paradigmatic, and we may use it here for the sake ofa concrete example. 

For many yearsbiologists considered protein sequences as being instructions coded in the DNA.It is clear, however, that DNA triplets are capable of predictably specifyingan aminoacid in a protein if and only if they are embedded in the cell’smetabolism, that is, in the thousands of enzymatic regulations in a complexchemical network. It is only because of the emergent regularities of such anetwork as a whole that we can bracket out this metabolic background and thustreat triplets as codes for aminoacids. In other words, the symbolicdescription is possible at another level. It is clearly possible to treat suchsymbolic regularities in their own right, but their status and interpretationis quite different from when we simply take them at face value, as if they wereindependent of the substratum from which they emerge.[25](#25_5)

The example of geneticinformation can be transposed directly to the cognitive networks with whichneuroscientists and connectionists work. In fact, some researchers haverecently expressed this point of view explicitly.[26](#26_5)In Paul Smolensky’s harmony theory, for example, fragmentary “atoms” ofknowledge about electrical circuits are linked by distributed statisticalalgorithms and so yield a model of intuitive reasoning in this domain. Thecompetence of this whole system can be described as doing inferences based onsymbolic rules, but the performance sits at a different level and is neverachieved by reference to a symbolic interpreter. 

How is this inclusiveview different from the cognitivist conception of levels of explanation? Thedifference is actually rather subtle and is mostly a matter of a shift inperspective. The basic point, agreed to by all, is that to formulateexplanatory generalizations we need the right kind of descriptive vocabulary ortaxonomy. Cognitivism, as we have seen, is founded on the hypothesis that thistaxonomy consists of symbols. This symbolic level constrains the kinds ofbehaviors that are possible for a cognitive system and so is thought to have anindependent, explanatory status. In the inclusive view, the need for a symboliclevel is acknowledged, but the possibility is left open that this level is onlyapproximate. In other words, symbols are not taken at face value; they are seenas approximate macrolevel descriptions of operations whose governing principlesreside at a subsymbolic level. 

Among the many issuesthat change given this possible synthesis, two in particular are worth noting.First, the question of the origin of a symbol and its meaning (why does ATTcode for alanine?) can be approached more clearly. Second, any symbolic levelbecomes highly dependent on the underlying network’s properties andpeculiarities, as well as bound to its history. A purely procedural account ofcognition, independent of its history and the way cognition is embodied, istherefore seriously questioned. 

The cognitivists’ replywill no doubt be that such a mixed or inclusive mode is fine if one isconcerned only with lower-level processes, such as those found in geneticcoding. But when one turns to higher-level processes, such as the ability toparse sentences or make inferences, an independent symbolic level will berequired. In the case of highly recursive structures, such as human language,it will be argued that the symbolic level is not approximate at all; it is theonly precise description available for forms of representation that areproductive and systematic.[27](#27_3) 

There is much to be saidfor this line of argument. The point to be made in reply, though, is that itunjustifiably limits the domain of cognition to very high level processes. Forexample, Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn write in a recent article, “It wouldnot be unreasonable to describe Classical cognitive science [cognitivism] as anextended attempt to apply the methods of proof theory to the modeling ofthought (and similarly, of whatever other mental processes are plausibly viewedas involving inferences; predominantly learning and perception). The point isnot that logical proofs per se are so important inhuman thought, but that the way of dealing with them provides a clue as to howto deal with knowledge-dependent processes in general.”[28](#28_3)Despite this last qualification, however, their argument later in the articleseems to require that deductive logic be the very paradigm of human thought andhence, presumably, of cognition in general. 

We simply see no reasonto give in to this narrow conception of cognition. There are many classes ofsystems, such as the neural networks described in this chapter, whose behaviorshould be seen as cognitive, and yet their abilities do not encompass thesehighly systematic and productive features. In fact, it is even possible toargue that there are nonneural networks that display cognitiveproperties—immune systems, for example.[29](#c5_note_29)When we widen our perspective to include such forms of cognitive behavior,symbolic computation might come to be regarded as only a narrow, highlyspecialized form of cognition. Although it might be possible to treat thisspecialized form as having a high degree of autonomy (by ignoring the largersystem in which it is embedded), the study of cognition would nonethelessinclude systems consisting of many networks of cognitive processes, eachperhaps with its own distinct cognitive domain. 

Cognitivism, perhaps inits desire to establish itself as a mature research program, has resisted sucha perspective. The emergence view, however, both in its early phase of thestudy of self-organizing systems and in its present connectionist form, is opento encompassing a greater variety of cognitive domains. An inclusive or mixedmode seems, therefore, a natural strategy to pursue. A fruitful link between aless orthodox cognitivism and the emergence view, where symbolic regularitiesemerge from parallel distributed processes, is a concrete possibility,especially in AI with its predominantly engineering, pragmatic orientation.This complementary endeavor will undoubtedly produce visible results and mightwell become the dominant trend for many years to come in cognitive science.[30](#30_3) 

We will not discussthese questions further, for they remain open and will be decided largely byfuture research. We wish to raise them simply in the context of our centralquestion: the dialogue between cognitive science and human experience.

# [6 ]()Selfless Minds 

## Societiesof Mind 

We have now seen in somedetail that brains are highly cooperative systems. Nonetheless, they are notuniformly structured networks, for they consist of many networks that arethemselves connected in various ways. As we have already sketched for the caseof the visual system, the entire system resembles a patchwork of subnetworksassembled by a complex process of tinkering, rather than a system that resultsfrom some clean, unified design. This kind of architecture suggests thatinstead of looking for grand, unified models for all network behaviors, oneshould study networks whose abilities are restricted to specific cognitiveactivities and then look for ways to connect the networks. 

This view of cognitivearchitecture has begun to be taken seriously by cognitive scientists in variousways. In this chapter we will see how it also provides a natural entry pointfor the next stage of the dialogue between cognitive science and themindfulness/awareness approach to human experience. To make the discussion clear,we will explore this next stage on the basis of Marvin Minsky’s and SeymourPapert’s recent proposal to study the mind as a society, for this proposaltakes the patchwork architecture of cognition as a central element.[1](#1_13) 

Minsky and Papertpresent a view in which minds consist of many “agents” whose abilities arequite circumscribed: each agent taken individually operates only in amicroworld of small-scale or “toy” problems. The problems must be of a smallscale because they become unmanageable for a single network when they arescaled up.[2](#2_13) This last point has not beenobvious to cognitive scientists. It is to a large extent a result of the manyyears of frustration in AI with attempts to find global solutions (for example,in the form of a General Problem Solver) and of the relative success in findingsolutions to more local tasks—solutions that cannot, however, be extendedbeyond specific domains. The task, then, is to organize the agents who operatein these specific domains into effective larger systems or “agencies,” andthese agencies in turn into higher-level systems. In doing so, mind emerges asa kind of society. 

It is important toremember here that, although inspired by a closer look at the brain, this modelis of the mind. In other words, it is not a model of neural networks orsocieties; it is a model of the cognitive architecture that abstracts fromneurological detail. Agents and agencies are not, therefore, entities ormaterial processes; they are abstract processes or functions. The reader is nodoubt familiar with this theme of various levels by now, but the point bearsemphasizing, especially since Minsky and Papert sometimes write as if they weretalking about cognition at the level of the brain.[3](#3_13)

The model of the mind asa society of numerous agents is intended to encompass a multiplicity ofapproaches to the study of cognition, ranging from distributed, self-organizingnetworks to the classical, cognitivist conception of localized, serial symbolicprocessing. The society of mind purports to be, then, something of a middle wayin present cognitive science. This middle way challenges a homogenous model ofthe mind, whether in the form of distributed networks at one extreme orsymbolic processers at the other extreme. 

This move is particularly apparent when Minsky and Papert argue thatthere are virtues not only to distribution but to insulation, that is, tomechanisms that keep various processes apart.[4](#4_13)The agents within an agency may be connected in the form of a distributednetwork, but if the agencies were themselves connected in the same way, theywould, in effect, constitute one large network whose functions were uniformlydistributed. Such uniformity, however, would restrict the ability to combinethe operations of individual agencies in a productive way. The more distributedthese operations are, the harder it is to have many of them active at the sametime without interfering with one another. These problems do not arise,however, if there are mechanisms to keep various agencies insulated from eachother. These agencies would still interact, but through more limitedconnections, such as those typical of sequential, symbolic processing. 

The details of such aview are, of course, debatable. But the overall picture of mind not as aunified, homogenous entity, nor even as a collection of entities, but rather asa disunified, heterogenous collection of networks of processes seems not onlyattractive but also strongly resonant with the experience accumulated in allthe fields of cognitive science. Such a society can obviously be considered atmore than one level. What counts as an agency, that is, as a collection ofagents, could, if we change our focus, be considered as merely one agent in alarger agency. And conversely, what counts as an agent could, if we resolve ourfocus in greater detail, be seen to be an agency made up of many agents. In thesame way, what counts as a society will depend too on our chosen level offocus. 

Let us take an example.Minsky begins his Society of Mind with the example ofan agent whose specialty is building towers out of toy blocks. But to build atower, one needs to start the tower, add new blocks, and decide when to finish.So this agent—Builder—requires the help of the sub-agents Begin, Add, andFinish, and these sub-agents require still more agents, such as Find and Pickup. The activities of all these agents combine to accomplish the task ofbuilding a tower. If we want to think of Builder as a single agent (ahomunculus, maybe even with a will, who performs actions), then Builder iswhatever it is that switches on all these agents. From the emergent point ofview, however, all of these agents combine to produce Builder as an agency thatconstructs toy towers. 

Minsky’s and Papert’ssociety of mind is not, of course, concerned with the analysis of directexperience. But Minsky draws on a delightfully wide range of human experience,from playing with children’s blocks to being an individual who is aware and canintrospect. In many ways, Minsky’s work is an extended reflection on cognitivescience and human experience, one that is committed to the “subpersonal,” butdoes not wish to lose sight for too long of the personal and experiential. Atcertain points, Minsky even senses the kinship between some of his ideas andthose of the Buddhist tradition, for he begins six of his pages with quotationsfrom the Buddha.[5](#5_13) 

Minsky does not followthe lead that his own citations suggest, however. He argues instead thatalthough there is no room for a truly existing self in cognitive science, wecannot give up our conviction in such a self. At the very end of The Society of Mind, science and human experience simplycome apart. And since we cannot choose between the two, we are ultimately leftwith a condition of schizophrenia, in which we are “condemned” (by ourconstitution) to believe in something we know not to be true (our personalselves). 

Let us emphasize thatthis kind of consequence is not peculiar to Minsky. Indeed, as we saw in ourdiscussion of Jackendoff, cognitivism forces us to separate cognition asrepresentation from cognition as consciousness and in so doing inevitably leadsus to the view that, in Jackendoff’s words, “consciousness is not good foranything.” Thus rather than building a genuine bridge between the computationaland the phenomenological mind, Jackendoff simply reduces the latter to a mere“projection” of the former. And yet, as Jackendoff also notes, “Consciousnessseems too important to one’s life—too much fun—to conceive of it as useless.”[6](#6_13) Thus once again science and humanexperience simply come apart. 

It is only by enlarging the horizon of cognitive science to include anopen-ended analysis of human experience that we will be able to avoid thispredicament. We will return to consider this impasse in its Minskian form ingreater detail. At this point, however, we will turn to a discussion of ideasof society and properties of emergence in two disciplines that examineexperience from perspectives other than cognitive science: we will discusspsychoanalysis briefly and the mindfulness/awareness meditation tradition atgreater length. 

## TheSociety of Object Relations 

Within psychoanalysis, anew school, so different from Freudian theory that it has been called aparadigm shift, has emerged.[7](#7_13) This is objectrelations theory. Freud already anticipated this theory in an embryonicform. For Freud, the superego results from the “internalization” of parentalmorality as an internalized parental figure. Freud also discussed particularpsychological states, such as the mourning process, in terms of relationsbetween the self and such an internalized parent. Object relations theory hasextended this idea to encompass all of psychological development and to act asan explanatory framework for adult functioning. In object relations theory, forexample in the work of Melanie Klein,[8](#8_11)the basic mental developmental process is the internalizing of a rich array ofpersons in various aspects. Fairbairn goes so far as to reconceptualize theconcept of motivation into object relations terms; for Fairbairn the basicmotivating drive of the human is not the pleasure principle but the need toform relationships.[9](#9_13) Horowitz joins object relationstheory to cognitive science by describing internalized object relations asinterpersonal schemas.[10](#c6_note_10) These schemas and subschemas actvery much as Minskian agents. 

The convergence betweenpsychoanalysis, in the form of object relations theory, and the concept of mindas a society in artificial intelligence is striking; Turkle suggests that thisconvergence may be of benefit to both.[11](#11_10)Object relations theory has been much criticized for reifying interdependent,fluid mental processes into an image of independent,static mental structures.[12](#12_8)In the society of mind portrayal of the emergence of agency from agents,however—as in our previous example, Builder—it becomes quite apparent how onecan structure such a conceptual system—how one can incorporate aspects of thedisunity of mind to which object relations theory points—without reification. 

Psychoanalysis is notjust theory but a practice. Troubled patients who see an object relationstherapist learn to explore their minds, behavior, and emotions in terms ofobject relations—they come to see their reactions in terms of internalizedagents. Does this, we wonder, lead them to question their basic sense of selfaltogether? This surely happens in some instances between a gifted therapistand a committed patient. But more generally it is unlikely to happen in thepresent cultural context in Britain and North America since psychoanalysis hasbeen co-opted by psychiatry to an important degree.[13](#13_9)Thus more often than not it is seen as medicine rather than as a means to gainknowledge about the nature of mind. A successful object relations analysis,like any other analysis, is designed to make the patient better—morefunctional, with improved object relations, and with greater emotional comfort;it is not designed to lead him to question, “Isn’t it odd that I am sozealously pursuing my object relations and my comfort when all I am is a set of object relationsschemas? What is going on?” In more general terms, it is apparent that objectrelations analysis, like other contemplative traditions, has discovered thecontradiction between the lack of a self that analysis discovers and ourongoing sense of self. It is not, however, apparent that psychoanalysis in theform of object relations theory has faced, or even fully acknowledged, thiscontradiction. Rather, object relations theory appears to accept the basicmotivation (the basic grasping) of the ongoing sense of self at face value andemploys analytic discoveries about the disunity of the self to cater to thedemands of the ongoing sense of self. Because object relations psychoanalysishas not systematically addressed this basic contradiction—the lack of a unitary self in experience versus the ongoingsense of self-grasping—the open-ended quality that is possible in analysis, thoughpresent in all psychoanalysis and particularly in object relations therapy, islimited. Lacanian analysis in Europe may be one exception, and it may havegained some of its power and notoriety because of this quality.[14](#14_9)A fuller discussion of this fascinating bridge between psychoanalysis andmodern cognitive science—and eventually with the meditation tradition—is,however, beyond the scope of this book. We therefore turn once again tomindfulness/awareness and the expositions of the Abhidharma. 

## CodependentArising 

How is it, if we have noself, that there is coherence in our lives? How is it, if we have no self, thatwe continue to think, feel, and act as though we had a self—endlessly seeking toenhance and defend that nonfindable, nonexperienced self? How and why do themomentary arisings of the elements of experience, the five aggregates andmental factors, follow one another temporally to constitute recurrent patterns?

The Buddha was said tohave discovered on the eve of his enlightenment not only the momentariness ofthe arising of the aggregates but also the entire edifice of causality—thecircular structure of habitual patterns, the binding chain, each link of whichconditions and is conditioned by each of the others—that constitutes thepattern of human life as a never-ending circular quest to anchor experience ina fixed and permanent self. This insight came to be named with the Sanskritword pratityasamutpada, which literally means “dependence(pratitya) upon conditions that are variouslyoriginated (samutpada).” We will use the term codependent arising, since that gloss best expresses theidea, familiar in the context of societies of mind, of transitory yetrecurrent, emergent properties of aggregate elements.[15](#15_8)

This circle is alsocalled the Wheel of Life and the Wheel of Karma. Karma is a topic with a longhistory, both pre- and post-Buddhist, on which an immense amount of scholarshiphas been focused.[16](#16_9) The word karmahas also found its way into contemporary English vocabulary where it isgenerally used as a synonym for fate or predestination. This is definitely not the meaning of karmawithin Buddhism. Karma constitutes a description of psychological causality—ofhow habits form and continue over time. The portrait of the Wheel of Life isintended to show how it is that karmic causality actually works. The emphasison causality is central to the tradition of mindfulness/awareness and as suchis quite compatible with our modern scientific sensibility; in the case ofmindfulness/awareness, however, the concern is with a causal analysis of directexperience, not with causality as an external form of lawfulness. The concernis also pragmatic: How can the understanding of causality be used to break thechains of conditioning mind (an idea quite contrary to the popular notion ofkarma as predestination) and foster mindfulness and insight? 

There are twelve links(called nidanas) in the circular chain (thepatterning situation as shown in [figure 6.1](#fig_001_3)). The circle is an analytic structure thatcan be used to describe events of any duration from a single moment to alifetime or, in the Buddhist view, to many lifetimes. Metaphorically, we couldsay that these motifs have a fractal character: the same patterns seem toappear even when we change the scale of observation by orders of magnitude.Descriptions of the twelve interdependent links follow.

[Figure 6.1](#fig_001a_3) Codependent arisingas the Wheel of Life. 

### 1 Ignorance

Ignorance is the groundof all karmic causal action. It means being ignorant of, not knowing, thetruth(s) about the nature of mind and reality. In the material we havediscussed so far, this means being ignorant—personally experientiallyignorant—of the lack of ego-self. It also means the confusions—the mistakenviews and emotions of believing in a self—that come from that ignorance. Henceit could also be rendered as bewilderment. (In later formulations, it came toinclude other truths about which a sentient being could be ignorant.) 

### 2 VolitionalAction 

Out of ignorance, oneacts on the basis of a self. That is to say, in the selfless state there are noself-oriented intentions. Because of ignorance of the lack of ego-self, theurge toward habitual, repetitive actions based on a self arises. Ignorance andvolitional action are the ground, the prior conditions, sometimes called thepast conditions, that give rise to the next eight links (the third through thetenth). If this analytic scheme is being used to talk about the links arisingin time, then these eight are said to constitute the present situation. 

### 3 Consciousness

Consciousness refers tosentience in general, the dualistic state we talked about as the fifthaggregate. It may mean the beginning of consciousness in the life of anysentient being or the first moment of consciousness in any given situation.Remember that consciousness is not the only mode of knowing; one is born into amoment or a lifetime of consciousness, rather than wisdom, because ofvolitional actions that were based on ignorance. If we are speaking of thearising of a particular moment of consciousness, its precise form (which of thesix sense bases it arises upon, whether it is pleasant, unpleasant, etc.) isconditioned by the seeds laid down by the volitional action(s) of the previouslink. 

### 4 ThePsychophysical Complex 

Consciousness requires abody and mind together. Moments of consciousness in a given situation cangravitate toward one or the other end of the psychophysical complex: perhapsthe consciousness is primarily sensory; perhaps it is primarily mental. 

### 5 TheSix Senses 

A body and mind meanthat one has the six senses. Even brief situations, for example, eating a pieceof fruit—involve moments of each of the six sense consciousnesses: one sees,hears, tastes, smells, touches, and one thinks. 

### 6 Contact

Having the six sensesmeans that each sense is able to contact its sense field, its appropriateobject. Any moment of consciousness involves contact between the sense and itsobject (contact is an omnipresent mental factor—see appendix B); withoutcontact, there is no sense experience. 

### 7 Feeling

Feeling—pleasurable,displeasurable, or neutral—arises from contact. All experience has a feelingtone (feeling is also an omnipresent factor). Feeling has, as its basis, one ofthe six senses. At the point of feeling, one is actually struck by the world—inphenomenological language, one could say that we find ourselves thrown into the world. 

### 8 Craving 

Craving arises from feeling.Although there are innumerable specific kinds of craving (84,000 in onesystem), the basic form of craving is desire for what is pleasurable andaversion for what is displeasurable. Craving is a fundamental, automaticreaction. 

Craving is an extremelyimportant juncture in this chain of causality. Up to this point, the links haverolled off automatically on the basis of past conditioning. At this point,however, the aware person can do something about the situation: he caninterrupt the chain or he can let it go on to the next link (grasping). Thehandling of craving is what determines the possibilities for perpetuation orchange. 

It is a traditionalexercise to contemplate the chain of codependent arising in both directions,backward as well as forward. Because such an exercise communicates well thecodependent emergent quality of this causal analysis, we will show what happenswhen we go backward in our reasoning from the point of craving: craving forpleasure requires that there be sense feelings; to have feelings, there must becontact with the objects of the senses; to contact the sense objects, theremust be the six sense faculties; for the six sense faculties to exist, theentire psychophysical organism is required; for there to be a psychophysicalorganism, there must be sentience. 

### 9 Grasping

Craving usually resultsimmediately in grasping and clinging. Grasping refers not only to graspingafter what one does not have and desires but also to aversion for what one hasand desires to be rid of. 

### 10 Becoming

Grasping automaticallysets off the reaction toward becoming, toward the formation of a new situationin the future. New tendencies and suppositions are formed as a result of thecumulative effect of the previous seven motifs, which themselves were set intomotion by volitional action based on ignorance. Becoming initiates theformation of new patterns that carry over into future situations. 

### 11 Birth

In birth, a newsituation, as well as a new mode of being in that situation, is finally born.It is usually at this point only that one senses the causal chain and wants todo something about it. It is at this point, perhaps, that Western philosopherstalk about akrasia (weakness of the will). The ironyis that in normal life, the point at which one wakes up to a situation is pastthe point where one can do anything about it. Birth into a new situation, evenan agreeable one, always has an edge of uncertainty. 

### 12 Decayand Death 

Wherever there is birth,there is death; in any process of arising, dissolution is inevitable. Momentsdie, situations die, and lives end. Even more obvious than the uneasiness ofbirth is the suffering (and lamentation, as is said) experienced when situationsor bodies grow old, decay, and die. In this circular chain of causality, deathis the causal link to the next cycle of the chain. The death of one moment ofexperience is, within the Buddhist analysis of causality, actually a causalprecondition for the arising of the next moment. If there is still ignoranceand confusion, the wheel will continue turning endlessly in the same fashion. 

The circle of conditioned human existence is called samsara,which is visualized as a perpetually spinning wheel of existence driven by arelentless causation and pervaded by unsatisfactoriness. There are many vividtraditional images for samsara: a ship lost at sea ina raging storm, a deer trapped in a hunter’s net, animals racing before ablazing forest fire. According to one traditional story, the Buddha on the eveof his enlightenment worked through the twelve links of the chain seeking a waythat the chain could be broken. Nothing could be done about the past; onecannot go back and remove past ignorance and volitional actions. And since oneis alive and has a psychophysical organism, the six sense fields and theircontact with objects are inevitable. Inevitable also are the feeling states towhich the senses give rise and the craving that results. But must craving leadto grasping? 

It is at this point,some traditions say, that the Buddha formulated the technique of mindfulness.By precise, disciplined mindfulness to every moment, one can interrupt thechain of automatic conditioning—one can notautomatically go from craving to grasping and all the rest. Interruption ofhabitual patterns results in further mindfulness, eventually allowing thepractitioner to relax into more open possibilities in awareness and to developinsight into the arising and subsiding of experienced phenomena. That is whymindfulness is the foundational gesture of all the Buddhist traditions. 

At this point, we mightreturn briefly to our theoretical formulation. We asked how there could becoherence in our lives over time if there were no self. In the language ofsocieties of mind, the answer lies in the concept of emergence. Just as anyagency emerges from the action of individual agents, so the repetitiouspatterns of habitual actions emerge from the joint action of the twelve links.And just as the existence of the action of each agent is definable only inrelation to the actions of all the others, so the operation of each of thelinks in the chain of codependent arising is dependent on all of the otherlinks. As in any agency, there is no such thing as a habitual pattern per seexcept in the operation of the twelve agent motifs, nor is there such a thingas the motifs except in relation to the operation of the entire cyclic system. 

The historical formationof various patterns and trends in our lives is what Buddhists usually mean by karma. It is this accumulation that gives continuity to thesense of ego-self, so evident in everyday, unreflective life. The mainmotivating and sustaining factor in this process is the omnipresent mentalfactor of intention (see appendix B). Intention—inthe form of volitional action—leaves traces, as it were, of its tendencies onthe rest of the factors from moment to moment, resulting in the historicalaccumulation of habits, tendencies, and responses, some wholesome and othersunwholesome. When the term karma is used loosely, itrefers to these accumulations and their effects. Strictly speaking, though,karma is the very process of intention (volitional action) itself, the maincondition in the accumulation of conditioned human experience. 

In many fields ofscience, we are familiar with the idea that coherence and development over timeneed not involve any underlying substance. In evolutionary changes in thehistory of life, patterns of animal populations give rise to new individuals onthe basis of the past (most tangibly expressed in the nuclear genetics of thepopulation) and on the basis of current actions (mating behavior leading todescendence and genetic recombinations). The tracks and furrows of this processare the species and subspecies. But in the logic of Darwin’s account ofevolution and the Buddhist analysis of experience into codependent arising, weare concerned with the processual transformation of the past into the futurethrough the intermediary of transitional forms that in themselves have nopermanent substance. 

The agent motifs in thechain of conditioned origination are fairly complex processes. Each of thesemay be thought of as composed of sub-agents, or more accurately as themselvesagencies composed of agents. In the mindfulness/awareness tradition, of course,the logic is focused upon immediate experience. Is there an experiential—orpragmatic—justification for increasing the layers of agency in the society ofcausality? 

## Basic Element Analysis 

We have already seen howa moment of consciousness is analyzed into subject, object, and mental factorsthat bind them together. This schematization was present in the earliestAbhidharma but was greatly elaborated in a technique called basic element (dharma) analysis,[17](#17_9)which reached its peak of eloquence in the Abhidharmakosaof Vasubandhu.[18](#18_9) (It is from this work that wehave taken the classification of mental factors presented in appendix B.) 

The term for basicelement in Sanskrit is dharma. Its most generalmeaning in a psychological context is “phenomenon”—not in the Kantian sensewhere phenomena are opposed to noumena but simply in the ordinary sense ofsomething that occurs, arises, or is found in experience. In its more technicalsense, it refers to an ultimate particular, particle, or element that isreached in an analytic examination. In basic element analysis, moments ofexperience (the dharmas) were considered analytically irreducible units; theywere, in fact, called ultimate realities, whereas the coherences of daily lifethat were composed of these elements—a person, a house—were called conventionalrealities. 

This idea thatexperience, or what the phenomenologist would call the life-world, can beanalyzed into a more fundamental set of constituents was also a central elementin Husserl’s phenomenological project. This project broke down because it was,among other things, purely abstract and theoretical. Basic element analysis, onthe other hand, was much more successful because it was generated from anopen-ended, embodied reflection: it arose as a way of codifying andinterpreting the results of the mindfulness/awareness examination ofexperience. Therefore, even when basic element analysis received certain kindsof devastating criticism from philosophers such as Nagarjuna, it couldnonetheless survive as a valuable practice, though seen in a different light. 

On a more theoreticallevel, philosophers might recognize some parallels between basic elementanalysis and the analytic, rationalist tradition in the West as exemplified byLeibniz, Frege, Russell, and the early Wittgenstein. In both traditions thereis a concern with analyzing complex aggregates of societies—whether these bethings in the world, linguistic or logical descriptions, mentalrepresentations, or direct experience—into their simple and ultimate constituents.Minsky, for example, upholds this analytic tradition when he writes that his“agents of the mind could be the long-sought ‘particles’ that … theories [ofmind] need.”[19](#19_9) Such reductionism is almostalways accompanied by realism: one adopts a realist stance toward whatever oneclaims as one’s privileged basis, one’s ultimate ground. 

Here, however, we comeupon an interesting difference between Western rationalism and the rationalismembodied in the Abhidharma. In the latter, the designation of basic elements asultimate reality, we are told, was not an assertion that the basic elementswere ontological entities in the sense of being substantially existent.[20](#20_9) Surely this is an interestingcase study—we have here a philosophical system, a reductive system, in whichreductive basic elements are postulated as ultimate realities but in whichthose ultimate realities are not given ontological status in the usual sense.How can that be? Emergents, of course, do not have the status of ontologicalentities (substances). Might we have a system here in which the basic elementsare themselves emergents? 

This question is all themore interesting because basic element analysis was not simply an abstract,theoretical exercise. It had both a descriptive and a pragmatic motivation. Theconcern of the meditator is to break the wheel of conditioned origination andbecome aware, wise, and free. She is told that she canactually experientially catch herself (within this emergent society of thewheel of the twelve links) at the moment of craving and can begin to undo herconditioning. Will a basic element analysis provide clarity that will help inthis task? 

We may remember that inbasic element analysis each element, each moment of consciousness, consists ofthe consciousness itself (called, in this system, the primary mind) and itsmental factors. The (momentary) mental factors are what bind the (momentary)object (which is, of course, always in one of the six sense fields). Thespecific quality of each moment of consciousness and its karmic effects onfuture moments depend upon which mental factors are present. 

The relationship betweenconsciousness and the mental factors seems remarkably similar to the relationbetween Minskian agencies and agents. The contemporary Tibetan scholar GesheRabten puts it thus: “The term ‘primary mind’ denotes the totality of a sensoryor mental state composed of a variety of mental factors. A primary mind is likea hand whereas the mental factors are like the individual fingers, the palm,and so forth. The character of a primary mind is thus determined by itsconstituent mental factors.”[21](#21_9) A hand is an agency of which thefingers, palm, etc., are agents; it is also an agent of the body. These aredifferent levels of description; neither agent nor agency would exist withoutthe other. Like the hand, we could call the primary mind an emergent. 

We would do well to lookonce again at the five omnipresent mental factors: contact, feeling,discernment, intention, and attention. 

### 1 Contact

Contact is a form ofrapport between the senses and their objects, a matching of sensitivity betweena sense and an object in the sense field. It is a relational property involvingthree terms: one of the six senses, a material or mental object, and theconsciousness based upon these two. There is evidence to suggest that thissensitivity was conceived as a dynamic process giving rise to emergence: theevidence is that contact, as a process, is described as being both a cause andan effect. As a cause, contact is the coming together of three distinct items—asense, an object, and the potential for awareness. As an effect, contact isthat which results from this process of coming together—a condition of harmonyor rapport among the three items. This rapport is not the property of either asense, an object, or an awareness per se. It is a property of the processes bywhich they interact, in other words, an emergent property. Because of one’sconditioning, one thinks that contact—sense organ, sense field, and senseconsciousness—implies a self; in this analysis it may be seen in a neutral,“scientific” light as an emergence. 

This conception ofcontact strikes us as quite remarkable. It could be applied almostword-for-word to our discussion of vision as a unitary phenomenon. In a culturethat did not have access to scientific notions of circular causality, feedback/feedforward,and emergent properties, nor to logical formalisms for handling self-reference,the only recourse for expressing an emergent may have been to say that aprocess is both cause and effect. Early Buddhism developed the idea of anemergent both at the (relatively) global level of codependent origination andthe (relatively) local level of contact; this development was of centralimportance to the analysis of the arising of experience without a self. Thissuggests that our current formulations of emergence are not simply logicaltricks soon to be replaced by some other way of conceptualizing phenomena;rather, our modern forms may be the rediscovery of a basic aspect of humanexperience. 

### 2 Feeling 

We have alreadydiscussed feeling as the second aggregate and the seventh link in the circle ofcodependent arising. Normally feelings lead instantly to reactions thatperpetuate karmic conditioning. Bare feelings, however, are neutral; it isone’s response that is, in the language of mental factor analysis, eitherwholesome or unwholesome. Normally we never actually experience our feelingsbecause the mind jumps so quickly to the reaction. Even a neutral feeling(often even more threatening to the sense of self than a displeasurable feelingbecause a neutral feeling seems less self-relevant) leads quickly to boredomand to the finding of any possible physical or mental occupation. Meditatorsoften report that they discover for the first time, in mindfulness practice,what it is like actually to experience a feeling. 

### 3 Discernment

Perception(discernment)/impulse was discussed as the third aggregate. It normally arisesinseparably with feeling. Through mindfulness, however, the meditator mayrecognize impulses of passion, aggression, and ignoring for what theyare—impulses that need not automatically lead to action. In terms of mentalfactor analysis, one may thus be able to choose wholesome rather thanunwholesome actions. (Eventually, when sufficient freedom from habitualpatterns has been obtained, perception/discernments can—according to some laterformulations—automatically give rise not to self-based impulses of passion,aggression, and ignoring but to impulses of wisdom and compassionate action.) 

### 4 Intention

Intention is anextremely important process, which functions to arouse and sustain theactivities of consciousness (with its mental factors) from moment to moment.Intention is the manner in which the tendency to volitional action (the secondlink) manifests itself in the mind at any given moment. There are no volitionalactions without intention. Thus, karma is sometimes said to be the process ofintention itself—that which leaves traces on which future habits will be based.Normally we act so rapidly and compulsively that we do not see intentions. Someschools of mindfulness training encourage meditators to spend periods of timein which they slow down activities so that they may become aware of theintentions that precede even very trivial volitional actions such as changingposition when one becomes uncomfortable. Awareness of intention is thus adirect aid to cutting the chain of conditioned orgination at the craving link. 

### 5 Attention

Attention, the finalfactor of the five omnipresent mental factors, arises in interaction withintention. Intention directs consciousness and the other mental factors towardsome general area, at which point attention moves them toward specificfeatures. (Remember the interaction of agents in Minsky’s description of theagency Builder.) Attention focuses and holds consciousness on some object. Whenaccompanied by apperception, attention serves as the basis for theobject-ascertaining factors (see appendix B) of recollection and mindfulness,as well as the positive mental factor of alertness. 

These five factors, whenjoined with various of the object-ascertaining and variable factors (listed inappendix B), produce the character of each moment of consciousness. The mentalfactors present at a given moment interact with each other such that thequality of each factor as well as the resultant consciousness is an emergent. 

Ego-self, then, is the historical pattern among moment-to-momentemergent formations. To make use of a scientific metaphor, we could say thatsuch traces (karma) are one’s experiential ontogeny (including but notrestricted to learning). Here ontogeny is understood not as a series oftransitions from one state to another but as a process of becoming that isconditioned by past structures, while maintaining structural integrity frommoment to moment. On an even larger scale, karma also expresses phylogeny, forit conditions experience through the accumulated and collective history of ourspecies. 

The precise nature ofthe lists and definitions of mental factors should not be taken toocompulsively. Different schools produced different lists of factors. Differentschools also disagreed (and disagree to this day) about how important it is forpractitioners to study such lists (they were traditionally burned in Zen),about the stage of development at which the individual should study theAbhidharma in general and such lists in particular (given that he should studythem at all) and about whether and how such lists should be used in meditativecontemplation. All schools of mindfulness/awareness meditation, however, agreethat intense mindfulness of what arises from moment to moment in the mind isnecessary if one is to start to undo karmic conditioning. 

We have achieved twomain goals by this analysis: First, we have seen how both a single moment ofconsciousness and the causal coherence of moments of consciousness over timecan be formulated in the language of emergence without the postulation of aself or any other ontological entity. Second, we have seen how suchformulations can be both experientially descriptive and pragmatically oriented.This latter point bears further discussion since the notion of pragmatics maytake an unfamiliar cast in a system that aims to undercut volitional(egocentric) action. 

## Mindfulnessand Freedom 

We have been speakingthroughout of a mindful, open-ended analysis of experience, an analysis thatincludes changes in the mind of the analyzers as they proceed in the analysis.Through mindfulness, the mindfulness/awareness practitioners can begin to interruptautomatic patterns of conditioned behavior (specifically, they can let go ofautomatic grasping when craving arises). This, in turn, leads to an increase inthe ability to be mindful and an eventual expansion of the field of attentioninto awareness that begins to penetrate the root ignorance. This awarenessleads to further insight into the nature of experience, which fosters furtherdesire and ability to give up the whole cycle of blind, habitual patterns basedon ignorance and egocentric volitional action. 

People often worry thatwere they to loosen their hold on craving and grasping, their desire would goaway, and they would become numb and catatonic. In fact, exactly the reverse isthe case. It is the mindless, the unaware, state of mind that is numb—swathedin a thick cocoon of wandering thoughts, prejudgments, and solipsisticruminations. As mindfulness grows, appreciation for the components ofexperience grows. The point of mindfulness/awareness is not to disengage themind from the phenomenal world; it is to enable the mind to be fully present inthe world. The goal is not to avoid action but to be fully present in one’sactions, so that one’s behavior becomes progressively more responsive andaware. 

In modern society,freedom is generally thought of as the ability to do whatever one wants. Theview of codependent origination is radically different. (One contemporaryBuddhist teacher even titled a book The Myth of Freedom.[22](#22_9)) Doing whatever one wants out ofa sense of ego (volitional action), according to this system, is the least freeof actions; it is chained to the past by cycles of conditioning, and it resultsin further enslavement to habitual patterns in the future. To be progressivelymore free is to be sensitive to the conditions and genuine possibilities ofsome present situation and to be able to act in anopen manner that is not conditioned by grasping and egoistic volitions. Thisopenness and sensitivity encompasses not only one’s own immediate sphere ofperceptions; it also enables one to appreciate others and to developcompassionate insight into their predicaments. The repeated glimpses reportedby practitioners of this openness and genuineness in human life explain thevitality of the mindfulness/awareness tradition. It also illustrates how a richtheoretical tradition can be naturally interwoven with human concerns. 

## SelflessMinds; Divided Agents 

From a contemporarystandpoint, then, Abhidharma appears as the study of the emergent formation ofdirect experience without the ground of an ego-self. It is remarkable how wellthe overall logical form of some Abhidharma formulations fits that ofcontemporary scientific concern with emergent properties and societies of mind.(Or perhaps we should state it the other way round.) These latter contemporaryscientific concerns have, however, been pursued independently of anydisciplined analysis and direct examination of human experience. Since thereader may still be skeptical that science and human experience are inseparablepartners, we will now turn to consider in more detail what happens when thispartnership is one-sided. What happens when the insight that mind is free ofself is generated from within the very heart of science and yet is notconnected to the rest of human experience? 

We have seen how a viewof selfless minds begins to take form with the cognitivist separation ofconsciousness and intentionality. We then saw how cognition can be studied asan emergent phenomenon in self-organizing, distributed networks. In thischapter, we have seen the usefulness of a mixed, “society” mode of descriptionfor cognitive processes and human experience. Of what use, then, is the idea ofa central agent or self? 

Most working cognitivescientists, and even some cognitivist philosophers, are content to ignore thisquestion. One of the virtues of both Minsky’s Society ofMind and Jackendoff’s Consciousness and theComputational Mind is that each recognizes this question quite early onand takes it as a central theme. Minsky in particular distinguishes between thelowercase self, which refers “in a general sense toan entire person,” and the uppercase Self, whichrefers to “that more mysterious sense of personal identity.” He then asks, “Isthis concept of a Self of any real use at all?” And he answers, “It isindeed—provided that we think of it not as a centralized and all-powerfulentity, but as a society of ideas that include both our images of what the mindis and our ideals about what it ought to be.”[23](#23_8)

The distinctions thatMinsky draws in these remarks are suggestive, especially in the context of ourdiscussion. They are close to the Buddhist distinction between the coherentpattern of dependently originated habits that we recognize as a person and theego-self that a person may believe she has and constantly grasps after butwhich does not actually exist. That is, the word selfis a convenient way of referring to a series of mental and bodily events andformations, that have a degree of causal coherence and integrity through time.And the capitalized Self does exemplify our sensethat hidden in these transitory formations is a real, unchanging essence thatis the source of our identity and that we must protect. But as we have seen,this latter conviction may be unfounded and, as Minsky insightfully notes, canactually be harmful. 

But equally interestingare the ways in which Minsky’s distinctions—or those of other cognitivescientists concerned with the same issue, such as Jackendoff—do not match thoseof the Buddhist tradition. We believe that the lack of fit is ultimately rootedin two related issues. First, contemporary cognitive science does notdistinguish between the idea or representation of a Self and the actual basisof that representation, which is an individual’s grasping after an ego-self.Cognitive science has challenged the idea that thereis a real thing to which the fomer applies, but it has not even thought toconsider the latter. Second, cognitive science does not yet take seriously itsown findings of the lack of a Self. 

Both of these stem fromthe lack of a disciplined method for examination and inclusion of humanexperience in cognitive science. The major result of this lack is the issuethat has been with us since the beginning: cognitive science offers us a purelytheoretical discovery, which remains remote from actual human experience, ofmind without self. 

For example Minsky, onthe same page from which the previous quotations were taken, writes that“perhaps it’s because there are no persons in ourheads to make us do the things we want—nor even ones to make us want to want—that we construct the myth that we’re inside ourselves.” This remark confuses two featuresof mind without self that we have repeatedly seen to be distinct: one is thelack of an ego-self and the other is grasping for an ego-self. We construct thebelief or inner discourse that there is an ego-self not because the mind isultimately empty of such a self but because the everyday conditioned mind isfull of grasping. Or to make the point in the vocabulary ofmindfulness/awareness, the belief is rooted in the accumulated tendencies thatfrom moment to moment give rise to the unwholesome mental factors thatreinforce grasping and craving. It is not the lack of an ego-self per se thatis the source of this ongoing belief and private internal conversation; it isthe emotional response to that lack. Since we habitually assume that there isan ego-self, our immediate response is to feel a loss when we cannotinferentially find the object of our convictions. We feel as if we have lostsomething precious and familiar, and so we immediately try to fill that losswith the belief in a self. But how can we lose something that we (that is, ourtemporary, emergent “wes”) never had? And if we never had an ego-self in thefirst place, what is the point of continually trying to maintain one by tellingourselves we’re inside ourselves? If it is to ourselves that we are talking inthis conversation, why should we need to tell ourselves all of this in thefirst place? 

This feeling of loss,though somewhat natural when one’s investigation is still at an inferentialstage, is heightened and prolonged when the discovery of the lack of selfremains purely theoretical. In the tradition of a mindful, open-endedexamination of experience, the initial conceptual realization of mind withoutself is deepened to the point where it is realized in a direct, personal way.The realization shifts from being merely inferential to being direct experiencethrough a journey where the actual practice of mindfulness/awareness plays acentral role. And as a form of direct experience, generations of meditatorsattest that the lack of an ego-self does not continue to be experienced as aloss that needs to be supplemented by a new belief or inner dialogue. On thecontrary, it is the beginning of a feeling of freedom from fixed beliefs, forit makes apparent precisely the openness and space in which a transformation ofwhat the subject itself is, or could be, becomes possible. 

Minsky suggests,however, that we embrace the idea of Self because “so much of what our minds dois hidden from the parts of us that are involved with verbal consciousness.”[24](#24_7) Similarly, Jackendoff suggeststhat “awareness reflects a curious amalgam of the effects on the mind of boththought and the real world, while leaving totally opaque the means by whichthese effects come about.”[25](#25_7) There are two problems with thisposition. In the first place, the hypothesized mental processes of which we areunaware are just that—processes hypothesized by the cognitivistinformation-processing model of the mind. It is this model that requires a hostof subpersonal hidden processes and activities, not our experiences of the minditself. But surely it is not these ever-changing phantoms of cognitive sciencethat we can blame for our belief that we personally have an ego-self; to thinkso would be a confusion of levels of discourse. In the second place, even if wedid have many mental activities at the subpersonal level inherently hidden fromawareness, how would that explain our belief in an ego-self? A glance at thecomplexity of Jackendoff’s and Minsky’s models of the mind suggests that were amind actually to have all of these mechanisms, awareness of them would notnecessarily even be desirable. Lack of awareness is not in itself a problem.What is a problem is the lack of discrimination and mindfulness of the habitualtendency to grasp, of which we can become aware. This type of mindfulness can be developed with great precision due tothe fundamentally discontinuous—and hence unsolid—nature of our experience. (Wehave seen how some of this discontinuity and lack of solidity is quiteconsonant with modern cognitive science, and we are now even able to observesome of it from a neurophysiological standpoint.) The cultivation of suchprecision is possible not just in formal periods of practice but in oureveryday lives. An entire tradition with numerous cultural variants andaccessible methods testifies to the possibility and actuality of this humanjourney of investigation and experience. 

As we can see from ourdiscussion of both Minsky and Jackendoff, cognitive science basically ignoresthis possibility. This indifferent attitude generates two significant problems.First, by means of this ignoring, cognitive science denies itself theinvestigation of an entire domain of human experience. Even though the“plasticity” of experience, especially in its perceptual forms, has becomesomething of a topic of debate among philosophers and cognitive scientists,[26](#26_7) no one is investigating the waysin which conscious awareness can be transformed as a result of practices suchas mindfulness/awareness. In the mindfulness/awareness tradition, in contrast,the possibility of such transformation is the cornerstone of the entire studyof mind.[27](#27_5) 

The second problem isthe one we have evoked from the very beginning of this book: science becomesremote from human experience and, in the case of cognitive science, generates adivided stance in which we are led to affirm consequences that we appear to beconstitutionally incapable of accepting. Explicit attempts to heal this gap arebroached only by a few, such as Gordon Globus, who asks the question, What is aneural network that it may be capable of supporting a Dasein,an embodied existence?[28](#28_5) or Sherry Turkle, who hasexplored a possible bridge between cognitive science and psychoanalysis.[29](#29_4) And yet, to the extent thatresearch in cognitive science requires more and more that we revise our naiveidea of what a cognizing subject is (its lack of solidity, its divideddynamics, and its generation from unconscious processes), the need for a bridgebetween cognitive science and an open-ended pragmatic approach to humanexperience will become only more inevitable. Indeed, cognitive science will beable to resist the need for such a bridge only by adopting an attitude that isinconsistent with its own theories and discoveries. 

The deep problem, then,with the merely theoretical discovery of mind without self in as powerful andtechnical a context as late-twentieth-century science is that it is almostimpossible to avoid embracing some form of nihilism. If science continues tomanipulate things without embracing a progressive appreciation of how we liveamong those things, then the discovery of mind without self will have no lifeoutside the laboratory, despite the fact that the mind in that laboratory isthe very same mind without self. This mind discovers its own lack of a personalground—a deep and remarkable discovery—and yet has no means to embody thatrealization. Without such embodiment, we have little choice but to deny theself altogether, without giving up for one moment our habitual craving for whathas just been denied us. 

By nihilismwe mean to refer precisely to Nietzsche’s definition: “Radicalnihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence whenit comes to the highest values that one recognizes.”[30](#30_5)In other words, the nihilistic predicament is the situation in which we knowthat our most cherished values are untenable, and yet we seem incapable ofgiving them up. 

This nihilisticpredicament emerges quite clearly in both Jackendoff’s and Minsky’s books. Aswe mentioned, Jackendoff claims, on the one hand, that “consciousness is notgood for anything,” and then, on the other hand, that consciousness is “tooimportant for one’s life—too much fun—to conceive of it as useless.” Thus forJackendoff belief in the causal efficacy of consciousness is untenable, and yethe—like the rest of us—is incapable of giving it up. 

A similar predicamentemerges at the end of Minsky’s book. On the last pages of his Society of Mind, Minsky examinesthe notion of free will, which he calls “the myth of the third alternative”between determinism and chance. Science tells us that all processes aredetermined or depend in part on chance. There is no room, therefore, for somemysterious third possibility called a “free will,” by which Minsky means “anEgo, Self, or Final Center of Control, from which we choose what we shall do atevery fork in the road of time.” 

What, then, is Minsky’sresponse to this predicament? The final paragraph of his second-to-last page isworth quoting in full: 

No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of thewill: that concept is essential to our model of the mental realm. Too much ofour psychology is based on it for us to ever give it up. We’re virtually forcedto maintain that belief, even though we know it’s false—except, of course whenwe’re inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs,whatever may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace. 

At the moment, it is thefeeling tone of Minsky’s dilemma that concerns us. Although he ends The Society of Mind a page later with the more upbeatthought that “whenever anything goes wrong there are always other realms ofthought,” the quotation on free will is actually his final vision of therelation between science and human experience. As with Jackendoff, science andhuman experience come apart, and there is no way to put them together again.Such a situation exemplifies perfectly Nietzsche’s hundred-year-old diagnosisof our cultural predicament. (The remark of Nietzsche’s we quoted is dated1887.) We are forced—condemned—to believe in something we know can’t be true. 

We are going to suchgreat lengths to discuss both Minsky’s and Jacken­doff’s work because each clearlypresents, in its own way, the predicament we all face. Indeed, Minsky andJackendoff have done us the great service of not shying away from thesituation, as do other scientists and philosophers who imagine that there aresecret recesses within the brain that hide an existing self[31](#c6_note_31)or who suppose that probability and uncertainty at the quantum level provide ahome for free will.[32](#32_3) 

Nevertheless, the issuesas discussed by Minsky and Jackendoff are rather starkly met. Both are sayingthat there is an unbridgeable contradiction between cognitive science and humanexperience. Cognitive science tells us that we do not have a Self that isefficacious and free. We cannot, however, give up such a belief—we are“virtually forced” to maintain it. The mindfulness/awareness tradition, on theother hand, says that we are most certainly notforced to maintain it. This tradition offers a fourth alternative, a vision offreedom of action that is radically different from our usual conceptions offreedom. 

Let us be clear thatthis is not an issue in the philosophy of free will. (We are resisting, withgreat effort, the urge to launch into a discussion of physical versusstructural determinism, prediction, and many other philosophical reactions toMinsky’s and Jackendoff’s claims.) What is at issue is that there is atradition the very heart of which is to examine such issues in experience.Virtually the entire Buddhist path has to do with going beyond emotionalgrasping to ego. Meditative techniques, traditions of study and contemplation,social action, and the organization of entire communities have been harnessedtoward this end. Histories, psychologies, and sociologies have been (and canbe) written about it. As we have described several times, human beings dotransform themselves (and they certainly do believe that they can transformthemselves) progressively in this way. The result, in this world view, is thatreal freedom comes not from the decisions of an ego-self’s “will” but fromaction without any Self whatsoever. 

What cognitive scienceis saying about selfless minds is important for human experience. Cognitivescience speaks with authority in modern society. Yet there is the danger thatcognitive scientists will follow Hume’s example: having brilliantly formulatedthe discovery of selfless minds, a discovery of fundamental relevance to thehuman situation, but conceiving of no way to bring that discovery together with everyday experience, they will have norecourse but to shrug and go off to any modern equivalent of backgammon. Wehave been attempting to offer instead a bridge back to human experience. 

## Mindingthe World 

We have spent the firstthree parts of this book looking for the self, but even when we could not findit, we never doubted the stability of the world. How could we, when it seemedto provide the setting for all of our examinations? And yet when, having discoveredthe groundlessness of the self, we turn toward the world, we are no longer surewe can find it. Or perhaps we should say that once we let go of a fixed self,we no longer know how to look for the world. We define the world, after all, asthat which is not-self, that which is different from the self, but how can wedo this when we no longer have a self as a reference point? 

Once more, we seem to belosing our grip on something familiar. Indeed, at this point most people willprobably become quite nervous and see the specters of solipsism, subjectivism,and idealism lurking on the horizon, even though we already know that we cannotfind a self to serve as the anchor point for such literally self-centeredviews. We are, perhaps, more attached to the idea that the world has a fixedand ultimate ground than we are to the idea of a personal self. We need, then,to pause and become fully aware of this anxiety that lies underneath thevarieties of cognitive and emergent realism. This task takes us to the nextstep of our journey.

[IV ]()Steps to a MiddleWay 

# [7 ]()The Cartesian Anxiety 

## A Sense of Dissatisfaction 

Why should it bethreatening to question the idea that the world has pregiven properties that werepresent? Why do we become nervous when we call into question the idea thatthere is some way that the world is “out there,” independent of our cognition,and that cognition is a re-presentation of that independent world? 

Our spontaneous andunreflective common sense would deny that these questions are scientific,perhaps by thinking, “How else could the mind and theworld be related?” The realist in us claims that our questions are simply“philosophical”—a polite way of making them seem interesting, yet alsoirrelevant. It is true that they are partly philosophical, but we can alsorephrase them as questions in cognitive science. What actually is thescientific basis for the idea that the mind is some kind ofinformation-processing device that responds selectively to pregiven features ofthe environment? Why do we assume that cognitive science cannot call intoquestion these notions of representation and information processing not justphilosophically but in its day-to-day research? 

To think that we cannotraise such issues is a blindness in contemporary common sense, deeplyentrenched in our Western tradition and recently reinforced by cognitivism.Thus even when the very ideas of representation and information processingchange considerably, as they do in the study of connectionist networks,self-organization, and emergent properties, some form of the realist assumptionremains. In cognitivism, the realism is at least explicit and defended; in theemergence approach, however, it often becomes simply tacit and unquestioned.This unreflective stance is one of the greatest dangers facing the field ofcognitive science; it limits the range of theories and ideas and so prevents abroader vision and future for the field. 

A growing number ofresearchers in all areas of cognitive science have expressed dissatisfactionwith the varieties of cognitive realism. This dissatisfaction derives from adeeper source than the search for alternatives to symbol processing or evenmixed “society of mind” theories: it is a dissatisfaction with the very notionof a representational system. This notion obscures many essential dimensions ofcognition not just in human experience but when we try to explain cognitionscientifically. These dimensions include the understanding of perception andlanguage, as well as the study of evolution and life itself. 

Our discussion so farhas focused on linking the two poles of science and human experience. Part IVwill continue this task, but by developing a nonrepresentationist alternativefrom within the heart of cognitive science. We now need to pause and reflect onthe scientific and philosophical roots of the very idea of representation. Weare thinking not merely of the current notions in cognitive science ofcomputation and information processing but of the entire philosophical tendencyto view the mind as a “mirror of nature.”[1](#1_15)

## Representation Revisited 

In the discussion ofcognitivism we distinguished between two senses of representation, which we nowneed to recall. On the one hand, there is the relatively uncontroversial notionof representation as construal: cognition always consists in construing orrepresenting the world a certain way. On the other hand, there is the muchstronger notion that this feature of cognition is to be explained by thehypothesis that a system acts on the basis of internal representations. Sinceit might seem that these two ideas amount to the same thing, we need to refineour distinction somewhat. 

We can begin by noting arelatively weak and uncontroversial sense of representation. This sense ispurely semantic: It refers to anything that can be interpreted as being aboutsomething. This is the sense of representation as construal, since nothing isabout something else without construing it as being some way. A map, forexample, is about some geographical area; it represents certain features of theterrain and so construes that terrain as being a certain way. Similarly, wordson a page represent sentences in a language, which may in turn represent or beabout still other things. This sense of representation can be made even moreprecise. If, for example, our concern happens to be with languages in a moreformal setting, we can say that the statements of a language represent theirconditions of satisfaction. For example, the statement “snow is white”—takenliterally—is satisfied if snow is white; the statement “pick up yourshoes”—again, taken literally—is satisfied if the shoes are picked up by theperson being addressed.[2](#2_15) 

This sense ofrepresentation is weak because it need not carry any strong epistemological orontological commitments. Thus it is perfectly acceptable to speak of a maprepresenting the terrain without worrying about such things as how maps gettheir meaning. It is also perfectly acceptable to think of a statement asrepresenting some set of conditions without making further assumptions aboutwhether language as a whole works this way or whether there really are facts inthe world separate from language that can then be re-presented by the sentencesof the language. Or we can even talk about experiential representations, suchas the image I have of my brother, without making any further assumptions abouthow this image arose in the first place. In other words, this weak sense ofrepresentation is pragmatic; we use it all the time without worry. 

The obviousness of suchan idea, however, is quickly transformed into a much stronger sense ofrepresentation that does carry quite heavy ontological and epistemologicalcommitments. This strong sense arises when we generalize on the basis of theweaker idea to construct a full-fledged theory of how perception, language, orcognition in general must work. The ontological and epistemological commitmentsare basically twofold: We assume that the world is pregiven, that its featurescan be specified prior to any cognitive activity. Then to explain the relationbetween this cognitive activity and a pregiven world, we hypothesize theexistence of mental representations inside the cognitive system (whether thesebe images, symbols, or subsymbolic patterns of activity distributed across anetwork does not matter for the moment). We then have a full-fledged theorythat says (1) the world is pregiven; (2) our cognition is of this world—even ifonly to a partial extent, and (3) the way in which we cognize this pregivenworld is to represent its features and then act on the basis of theserepresentations. 

We must, then, return toour earlier metaphor, the idea of a cognitive agent that is parachuted into apregiven world. This agent will survive only to the extent that it is endowedwith a map and learns to act on the basis of this map. In the cognitivistversion of this story, the map is an innately specified system of representations—sometimescalled a “language of thought”—whereas learning to employ this map is the taskof ontogeny. 

Many cognitive scientists will object that we have presented acaricature. Are we not presupposing a static conception of representation, one thatoverlooks the rich detail of the inner structure of a cognitive system andunjustifiably construes a representation as merely a mirror? Is it not wellknown, for example, that visual perception is considered to be a result ofmapping the physical patterns of energy that stimulate the retina intorepresentations of the visual scene, which are then used to make inferences andeventually to produce a perceptual judgment? Perception is seen as an activeprocess of hypothesis formation, not as the simple mirroring of a pregivenenvironment. 

This objection, thoughsomewhat fair, misses the point. Our point is not to caricature a sophisticatedresearch program but simply to render explicit some tacit epistemologicalassumptions in as clear a fashion as possible. Thus although everyone agreesthat representation is a complex process, it is nonetheless conceived to be oneof recovering or reconstructing extrinsic, independent environmental features.Thus in vision research, for example, one speaks of “recovering shape fromshading” or “color from brightness.” Here the latter features are considered tobe extrinsic properties of the environment that provide the information neededto recover “higher-order” properties of the visual scene, such as shape andcolor. The basic idea of a world with pregiven features remains.[3](#3_15)

The complaint that wehave presented a caricature would, however, be justified were we not toacknowledge the subtlety and sophistication of cognitive realism in relation tothe classical opposition between realism and idealism in philosophy. In thehands of cognitive realism, the notion of representation does undergo somethingof a mutation. The power of this mutation is that it seems to offer a way outof the classical opposition between realism and idealism. 

This opposition is basedin the traditional notion of representation as a “veil of ideas” that standsbetween us and the world. On the one hand, the realist naturally thinks thatthere is a distinction between our ideas or concepts and that which theyrepresent, namely, the world. The ultimate court of appeal for judging thevalidity of our representations is this independent world. Of course, each ofour representations must cohere with many others, but the point of suchinternal features is to increase the probability that globally ourrepresentations will have some measure of correspondence or degree of fit withan outer and independent world. 

The idealist, on theother hand, quickly points out that we have no access to such an independentworld except through our representations. We cannot stand outside of ourselvesto behold the degree of fit that our representations might have with the world.In fact, we simply have no idea of what the outside world is except that it isthe presumed object of our representations. Taking this point to the extreme,the idealist argues that the very idea of a world independent ofrepresentations is itself only another of our representations—a second-order ormetarepresentation. Our sense of an outer ground thus slips away, and we areleft grasping for our internal representations, as if these could provide asure and stable reference point. 

At first sight,contemporary cognitive science seems to offer a way out of this traditionalphilosophical impasse. Largely because of cognitive science, philosophicaldiscussion has shifted from concern with a priori representations(representations that might provide some noncontingent foundation for ourknowledge of the world) to concern with a posteriori representations(representations whose contents are ultimately derived from causal interactionswith the environment). This naturalized conception of representation does notinvite the skeptical questions that motivate traditional epistemology. In fact,to shift one’s concern to organism-environment relations in this way is largelyto abandon the task of traditional a priori epistemology in favor of thenaturalized projects of psychology and cognitive science.[4](#4_15)By taking up such a naturalized stance, cognitive science avoids the antinomiesthat lurk in transcendental or metaphysical realism, without embracing thesolipsism or subjectivism that constantly threatensidealism. The cognitive scientist is thus able to remain a staunch realistabout the empirical world while making the details of mind and cognition thesubject of his investigations. 

Cognitive science thusseems to provide a way of talking about representation without being burdenedby the traditional philosophical image of the mind as a mirror of nature. Butthis appearance is misleading. It is true, as Richard Rorty remarks, that thereis no way to raise the traditional skeptical questions of epistemology incognitive science. Global skepticism about the possibility of cognition orknowledge is simply not to the point in the practice of science. But it doesnot follow, as Rorty seems to think, that the current naturalized conception ofrepresentation has nothing to do with the traditional image of the mind as amirror of nature.[5](#5_15) On the contrary, a crucial featureof this image remains alive in contemporary cognitive science—the idea of aworld or environment with extrinsic, pregiven features that are recoveredthrough a process of representation. In some ways cognitivism is the strongeststatement yet of the representational view of the mind inaugurated by Descartesand Locke. Indeed, Jerry Fodor, one of cognitivism’s leading and most eloquentexponents, goes so far as to say that the onlyrespect in which cognitivism is a major advance over eighteenth- andnineteenth-century representationism is in its use of the computer as a modelof mind.[6](#c7_note_6) 

As we have seen,however, cognitivism is only one variety of cognitive realism. In both theemergence and society of mind approaches (and in the schools of basic elementsanalysis for the experiential pole of our investigation), the notion ofrepresentation becomes more and more problematical. We did not explicitlyquestion this notion in our discussion of the varieties of cognitive realism,but if we look back on our journey, we can see that we have slowly drifted awayfrom the idea of mind as an input-output device that processes information. Therole of the environment has quietly moved from being the preeminent referencepoint to receding more and more into the background, while the idea of mind asan emergent and autonomous network of relationships has gained a central place.It is time, then, to raise the question, What is it about such networks, ifanything, that is representational? 

To make this questionsomewhat more accessible, consider once again Minsky’s discussion toward theend of Society of Mind. There he writes, “Whenever wespeak about a mind, we’re speaking of the processes that carry our brains fromstate to state … concerns about minds are really concerns with relationshipsbetween states—and this has virtually nothing to do with the natures of thestates themselves.”[7](#7_15) How, then, are we to understandthese relationships? What is it about them that makes them mindlike? 

The answer that isusually given to this question is, of course, that these relationships must beseen as embodying or supporting representations of the environment. Notice,however, that if we claim that the function of these processes is to representan independent environment, then we are committed to construing these processesas belonging to the class of systems that are driven from the outside, that aredefined in terms of external mechanisms of control (a heteronomoussystem). Thus we will consider information to be a prespecified quantity, onethat exists independently in the world and can act as the input to a cognitivesystem. This input provides the initial premises upon which the system computesa behavior—the output. But how are we to specify inputs and outputs for highlycooperative, self-organizing systems such as brains? There is, of course, aback-and-forth flow of energy, but where does information end and behaviorbegin? Minsky puts his finger on the problem, and his remarks are worth quotingat length: 

[Why are processes so hardto classify? In earlier times, we could usually judge machines and processes byhow they transformed raw materials into finished products. But it makes nosense to speak of brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factoriesmake cars. The difference is that brains use processes thatchange themselves—and this means we cannot separate such processes fromthe products they produce. In particular, brains make memories, which changethe ways we’ll subsequently think. The principal activitiesof brains are making changes in themselves. Because the whole idea ofself-modifying processes is new to our experience, we cannot yet trust ourcommonsense judgement about such matters.]()[8](#8_13) 

What is remarkable aboutthis passage is the absence of any notion of representation. Minsky does notsay that the principal activity of brains is to represent the external world;he says that it is to make continuous self-modifications. What has happened tothe notion of representation? 

In fact, an importantand pervasive shift is beginning to take place in cognitive science under thevery influence of its own research. This shift requires that we move away fromthe idea of the world as independent and extrinsic to the idea of a world asinseparable from the structure of these processes of self-modification. Thischange in stance does not express a mere philosophical preference; it reflectsthe necessity of understanding cognitive systems not on the basis of theirinput and output relationships but by their operationalclosure.[9](#9_15) A system that has operationalclosure is one in which the results of its processes are those processesthemselves. The notion of operational closure is thus a way of specifying classesof processes that, in their very operation, turn back upon themselves to formautonomous networks. Such networks do not fall into the class of systemsdefined by external mechanisms of control (heteronomy) but rather into theclass of systems defined by internal mechanisms of self-organization(autonomy).[10](#10_14) The key point is that suchsystems do not operate by representation. Instead of representingan independent world, they enact a world as a domainof distinctions that is inseparable from the structure embodied by thecognitive system. 

We wish to evoke thepoint that when we begin to take such a conception of mind seriously, we mustcall into question the idea that the world is pregiven and that cognition isrepresentation. In cognitive science, this means that we must call intoquestion the idea that information exists ready-made in the world and that itis extracted by a cognitive system, as the cognitivist notion of an informavore vividly implies. 

But before we go anyfurther, we need to ask ourselves why the idea of a world with pregivenfeatures or ready-made information seems so unquestionable. Why are we unableto imagine giving up this idea without falling into some sort of subjectivism,idealism, or cognitive nihilism? What is the source of this apparent dilemma?We must examine directly the feeling that arises when we sense that we can nolonger trust the world as a fixed and stable reference point. 

## TheCartesian Anxiety 

The nervousness that wefeel is rooted in what, following Richard Bernstein, we can call “the Cartesiananxiety.”[11](#11_12) We mean “anxiety” in a looselyFreudian sense, and we call it “Cartesian” simply because Descartes articulatedit rigorously and dramatically in his Meditations.The anxiety is best put as a dilemma: either we have a fixed and stablefoundation for knowledge, a point where knowledge starts, is grounded, andrests, or we cannot escape some sort of darkness, chaos, and confusion. Eitherthere is an absolute ground or foundation, or everything falls apart. 

There is a marvelouspassage from Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason thatconveys the power of the Cartesian anxiety.Throughout the Critique Kant builds the edifice ofhis theory of knowledge by arguing that we have a priori or given, innatecategories, which are the foundations of knowledge. Toward the end of hisdiscussion of the “Transcendental Analytic” he writes, 

We have now not merely explored the territory of pure understanding[the a priori categories] and carefully surveyed every part of it, but havealso measured its extent and assigned to everything in it its rightful place.This domain is an island, enclosed by nature itself with unalterable limits. Itis the land of truth—an enchanting name!—surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean,the native home of illusion, where many a fog bank and many a swiftly meltingiceberg give the deceptive appearance of farther shores, deluding theadventurous seafarer ever anew with empty hopes, and engaging him inenterprises which he can never abandon and yet is unable to carry tocompletion.[12](#12_10) 

Here we have the twoextremes, the either-or of the Cartesian anxiety: There is the enchanting landof truth where everything is clear and ultimately grounded. But beyond thatsmall island there is the wide and stormy ocean of darkness and confusion, thenative home of illusion. 

This feeling of anxietyarises from the craving for an absolute ground. When this craving cannot besatisfied, the only other possibility seems to be nihilism or anarchy. Thesearch for a ground can take many forms, but given the basic logic ofrepresentationism, the tendency is to search either for an outer ground in theworld or an inner ground in the mind. By treating mind and world as opposedsubjective and objective poles, the Cartesian anxiety oscillates endlesslybetween the two in search of a ground. 

It is important torealize that this opposition between subject and object is not given andready-made; it is an idea that belongs to the human history of mind and naturethat we mentioned in chapter 1. For example, prior to Descartes, the term“idea” was used only for the contents of the mind of God; Descartes was one ofthe first to take this term and apply it to the workings of the human mind.[13](#13_11) This linguistic and conceptualshift is one aspect of what Richard Rorty describes as the “invention of themind as a mirror of nature,” an invention that was the result of patchingtogether heterogenous images, conceptions, and linguistic usages.[14](#14_11) 

These Cartesian rootsbecome quite obvious when we have reason to doubt the appropriateness of thismetaphor of mirroring. As we set out in search of other ways of thinking, theCartesian anxiety arises to dog us at every step. Yet our contemporarysituation is also unique, for we have become increasingly skeptical about thepossibility of discerning any ultimate ground. Thus when the anxiety arisestoday, we seem unable to avoid the turn toward nihilism, for we have notlearned to let go of the forms of thinking, behavior, and experience that leadus to desire a ground. 

We saw in our previousdiscussion that cognitive science is not immune from this nihilistic tendency.For example, the link between nihilism and the Cartesian anxiety can be seenvery clearly in The Society of Mind when Minskyconfronts our inability to find a fully independent world. As he notes, theworld is not an object, event, or process inside the world.[15](#15_10)Indeed the world is more like a background—a setting of and field for all ofour experience, but one that cannot be found apart from our structure,behavior, and cognition. For this reason, what we say about the world tells usas much about ourselves as it does about the world. 

Minsky’s response tothis realization is a mixed one, in a way that is similar to his response tothe lack of a Self. He writes, “Whatever you purport to say about a thing,you’re only expressing your own beliefs. Yet even that gloomy thought suggestsan insight. Even if our models of the world cannot yield good answers about theworld as a whole, and even though their other answers are frequently wrong,they can tell us something about ourselves.”[16](#16_11) On the one hand, Minsky uses theimpossibility of finding a fully independent andpregiven world as an opportunity for developing insight into ourselves. But onthe other hand, this insight is based in a feeling of gloominess about oursituation. Why should this be? 

We have been portrayingthese ideas through the words of Minsky because he is an outstanding moderncognitive scientist and has actually taken the time to articulate his ideasclearly. But he is not alone. When pressed to discuss this issue, many peoplewould accept that we do not really have knowledge of the world; we haveknowledge only of our representations of the world. Yet we seem condemned byour constitution to treat these representations as if they were the world, forour everyday experience feels as if it were of a given and immediate world. 

Such a situation doesindeed seem gloomy. But notice that such gloominess would make sense only ifthere were a pregiven, independent world—an outer ground—but one that we couldnever know. Given such a situation, we would have no choice but to fall back onour inner representations and treat them as if they provided a stable ground. 

This mood of gloominessarises, then, from the Cartesian anxiety and its ideal of the mind as a mirrorof nature. According to this ideal, knowledge should be of an independent,pregiven world, and this knowledge should be attained in the precision of arepresentation. When this ideal cannot be satisfied, we fall back uponourselves in search of an inner ground. This oscillation is apparent inMinsky’s remark that whatever one purports to say is only an expression ofone’s beliefs. To say that what one thinks is only a matter of subjectiverepresentation is precisely to fall back upon the idea of an inner ground, asolitary Cartesian ego that is walled in by the privacy of its representations.This particular turn is all the more ironic, since Minsky does not believe thatthere exists a self that could serve as an inner ground in the first place. Inthe end, then, Minsky’s entanglement in the Cartesian anxiety requires not onlythat we believe in a self that we know cannot be found but also that we believein a world to which we have no access. And once again, the logic of such apredicament leads inevitably to a condition of nihilism. 

## Stepsto a Middle Way 

We have already seen inour exploration of human experience through the practice ofmindfulness/awareness that our grasping after an inner ground is the essence ofego-self and is the source of continuous frustration. We can now begin toappreciate that this grasping after an inner ground is itself a moment in alarger pattern of grasping that includes our clinging to an outer ground in theform of the idea of a pregiven and independent world. In other words, ourgrasping after a ground, whether inner or outer, is the deep source offrustration and anxiety. 

This realization lies atthe heart of the theory and practice of the Madhyamakaor “middle way” school of the Buddhist tradition. Whether one tries to find anultimate ground inside or outside the mind, the basic motivation and pattern ofthinking is the same, namely, the tendency to grasp. In Madhyamaka, thishabitual tendency is considered to be the root of the two extremes of“absolutism” and “nihilism.” At first, the grasping mind leads one to searchfor an absolute ground—for anything, whether inner or outer, that might byvirtue of its “own-being” be the support and foundation for everything else.Then faced with its inability to find any such ultimate ground, the graspingmind recoils and clings to the absence of a ground by treating everything elseas illusion. 

There are, then, twofundamental respects in which the philosophical analysis of Madhyamaka isdirectly relevant to our predicament. First, it explicitly recognizes that thesearch for an ultimate ground—what today we would call the projectof foundationalism—is not limited to the notion of the subject and its basis in what we have called ego-self; it also includes our belief in a pregiven orready-made world. This point, realized in India centuries ago and elaborated inthe diverse cultural settings of Tibet, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, hasonly begun to be appreciated in Western philosophy in the past one hundredyears or so. Indeed, most of Western philosophy has been concerned with theissue of where an ultimate ground is to be found, not with calling intoquestion or becoming mindful of this very tendency to cling to a ground. 

Second, Madhyamakaexplicitly recognizes the link between absolutism and nihilism. Ourethnocentric narratives tell us that concern with nihilism—in its preciseNietzschean sense—is a Western phenomenon due, among other things, to thecollapse of theism in the nineteenth century and the rise of modernism. Thepresence of a deep concern with nihilism in Indian philosophy from evenpre-Buddhist times should challenge such an ethnocentric assumption. 

Within the tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation, the motivation has been to develop a directand stable insight into absolutism and nihilism as forms of grasping thatresult from the attempt to find a stable ego-self and so limit our lived worldto the experience of suffering and frustration. By progressively learning tolet go of these tendencies to grasp, one can begin to appreciate that allphenomena are free of any absolute ground and that such “groundlessness”(sunyata) is the very fabric of dependent coorigination. 

We could make a somewhatsimilar point phenomenologically by saying that groundlessness is the verycondition for the richly textured and interdependent world of human experience.We expressed this point in our very first chapter by saying that all of ouractivities depend on a background that can never be pinned down with any senseof ultimate solidity and finality. Groundlessness, then, is to be found not insome far off, philosophically abstruse analysis but in everyday experience.Indeed, groundlessness is revealed in cognition as “common sense,” that is, inknowing how to negotiate our way through a world that is not fixed and pregivenbut that is continually shaped by the types of actions in which we engage. 

Cognitive science hasresisted this view, preferring to see any form of experience as at best “folkpsychology,” that is, as a rudimentary form of explanation that can bedisciplined by representational theories of mind. Thus the usual tendency is tocontinue to treat cognition as problem solving in some pregiven task domain.The greatest ability of living cognition, however, consists in being able topose, within broad constraints, the relevant issues that need to be addressedat each moment. These issues and concerns are not pregiven but are enacted from a background of action, where what counts asrelevant is contextually determined by our common sense.

# [8 ]()Enaction: Embodied Cognition 

## Recovering Common Sense 

The tacit assumptionbehind the varieties of cognitive realism (cognitivism, emergence, and thesociety of mind) has been that the world can be divided into regions ofdiscrete elements and tasks. Cognition consists in problem solving, which must,if it is to be successful, respect the elements, properties, and relationswithin these pregiven regions. 

This approach tocognition as problem solving works to some degree for task domains in which itis relatively easy to specify all possible states. Consider for example thegame of chess. It is relatively easy to define the constituents of the “spaceof chess”: there are positions on the board, rules for movements, turns thatare taken, and so on. The limits of this space are clearly defined; in fact, itis an almost crystalline world. It is not surprising, then, that chess playingby computer is an advanced art. 

For less circumscribedor well-defined task domains, however, this approach has proved to beconsiderably less productive. Consider, for example, a mobile robot that issupposed to drive a car within a city. One can still single out in this“driving space” discrete items, such as wheels and windows, red lights, andother cars. But unlike the world of chessplaying, movement among objects is nota space that can be said to end neatly at some point. Should the robot payattention to pedestrians or not? Should it take weather conditions intoaccount? Or the country in which the city is located and its unique drivingcustoms? Such a list of questions could go on forever. The driving world doesnot end at some point; it has the structure of ever-receding levels of detailthat blend into a nonspecific background. Indeed, successfully directedmovement such as driving depends upon acquired motor skills and the continuoususe of common sense or background know-how. 

Such commonsenseknowledge is difficult, perhaps impossible, to package into explicit,propositional knowledge—“knowledge that” in thephilosopher’s jargon—since it is largely a matter of readiness to hand or“knowledge how” based on the accumulation ofexperience in a vast number of cases. Recent examinations of how skills areacquired appear to confirm this point.[1](#1_17)Furthermore, when we enlarge the task domains from artificial microworlds tothe world at large, it is not clear that we can even specify what is to countas an object independent of the type of action that is being performed. Theindividuation of objects, properties, and events appears to vary according tothe task at hand.[2](#2_17) 

These points are not newto the field of cognitive science, although their full import has only begun tobe appreciated. Indeed, it is fair to say that by the 1970s, after two decadesof humblingly slow progress, it dawned on many workers in cognitive sciencethat even the simplest cognitive action requires a seemingly infinite amount ofknowledge, which we take for granted (it is so obvious as to be invisible) butwhich must be spoon-fed to the computer. The early cognitivist hope for ageneral problem solver had to be abandoned in favor of programs that would runin local knowledge domains, where small-scale problems could be solved and wherethe programmer could put into the machine as much of her background knowledgeas was necessary. Similarly, the current connectionist strategy depends eitheron restricting the space of possible attractors by means of assumptions aboutthe known properties of the world, which are incorporated as additionalconstraints for regularization,3 or, in more recentmodels, on using backpropagation methods where learning resembles the imitationof an external model. Thus in both cognitivism and connectionism, theunmanageable ambiguity of background common sense is left largely at theperiphery of the inquiry, with the hope that it will somehow eventually beclarified.[4](#4_17) 

If, however, our livedworld does not have predefined boundaries, then it seems unrealistic to expectto capture commonsense understanding in the form of a representation—where representation is understood in its strong sense as there-presentation of a pregiven world.[5](#5_17)Indeed, if we wish to recover common sense, then we must invert therepresentationist attitude by treating context-dependent know-how not as aresidual artifact that can be progressively eliminated by the discovery of moresophisticated rules but as, in fact, the very essence of creativecognition. 

This attitude towardcommon sense has begun to affect the field of cognitive science, especially inartificial intelligence. We should note, however, that the philosophical sourcefor this attitude is to be found largely in recent Continental philosophy,especially in the school of philosophical hermeneutics, which is based in theearly work of Martin Heidegger and his student Hans Gadamer.[6](#6_16)The term hermeneutics originally referred to thediscipline of interpreting ancient texts, but it has been extended to denotethe entire phenomenon of interpretation, understood as the enactmentor bringing forth of meaning from a background ofunderstanding. In general, Continental philosophers, even when they explicitlycontest many of the assumptions underlying hermeneutics, have continued toproduce detailed discussions that show how knowledge depends on being in aworld that is inseparable from our bodies, our language, and our socialhistory—in short, from our embodiment.[7](#c8_note_7) 

Although severalcognitive scientists have recently turned to these discussions for inspiration,the spontaneous philosophy of cognitive science continues to resist such anonobjectivist orientation. The varieties of cognitive realism are inparticular strongly tied to analytic philosophy, which tends to view folk psychologyas a tacit theory in need of either reduction or replacement.[8](#8_15)Indeed, it is fair to say that analytic philosophy in general resists thisnotion of cognition as embodied understanding. Thus as Mark Johnson notes in arecent work, 

The idea that understanding is an event in which one has a world, or,more properly, a series of ongoing related meaning events in which one’s worldstands forth, has long been recognized on the Continent, especially in the workof Heidegger and Gadamer. But Anglo-American analytic philosophy hassteadfastly resisted this orientation in favor of meaning as a fixed relationbetween words and the world. It has been mistakenly assumed that only aviewpoint that transcends human embodiment, cultural embeddedness, imaginativeunderstanding, and location within historically evolving traditions canguarantee the possibility of objectivity.[9](#9_17)

The central insight ofthis nonobjectivist orientation is the view that knowledge is the result of anongoing interpretation that emerges from our capacities of understanding. Thesecapacities are rooted in the structures of our biological embodiment but arelived and experienced within a domain of consensual action and culturalhistory. They enable us to make sense of our world; or in more phenomenologicallanguage, they are the structures by which we exist in the manner of “having aworld.” To quote Johnson once more, 

[Meaning includes patternsof embodied experience and preconceptual structures of our sensibility (i.e.,our mode of perception, or orienting ourselves, and of interacting with otherobjects, events, or persons). These embodied patterns do not remain private orpeculiar to the person who experiences them. Our community helps us interpretand codify many of our felt patterns. They become shared cultural modes ofexperience and help to determine the nature of our meaningful, coherentunderstanding of our “world.”]()[10](#10_16) 

Although these themesare derived from Continental philosophy, most of the Continental discussionshave proceeded without taking into consideration scientific research on cognition—themajor exception being the early work of Merleau-Ponty. The challenge posed bycognitive science to the Continental discussions, then, is to link the study ofhuman experience as culturally embodied with the study of human cognition inneuroscience, linguistics, and cognitive psychology. In contrast, the challengeposed to cognitive science is to question one of the more entrenchedassumptions of our scientific heritage—that the world is independent of theknower. If we are forced to admit that cognition cannot be properly understoodwithout common sense, and that common sense is none other than our bodily andsocial history, then the inevitable conclusion is that knower and known, mindand world, stand in relation to each other through mutual specification ordependent coorigination. 

If this critique isvalid, then scientific progress in understanding cognition will not beforthcoming unless we start from a different basis from the idea of a pregivenworld that exists “out there” and is internally recovered in a representation.In recent years, a few researchers within cognitive science have taken thiscritique from the philosophical level into the laboratory and into specificwork in AI. These researchers have put forth concrete proposals that involve amore radical departure from cognitivism than is found in the emergenceapproach, and yet they incorporate the ideas and methods developed within thiscontext. 

## Self-OrganizationRevisited 

In the previous chapter,we discussed how cognitive science has slowly drifted away from the idea ofmind as an input–output device that processes information toward the idea ofmind as an emergent and autonomous network. We intend to make this idea moretangible by providing a concrete example of what we mean by an autonomoussystem. 

Our example is based onthe simple cellular automata, which we introduced to exemplify how systemsexhibit emergent properties when endowed with network architectures. In theprevious account these cellular automata were completely decoupled entities,and so their emergent states were not constrained by a history of coupling withan appropriate world. By enriching our account to include this dimension of structural coupling, we can begin to appreciate thecapacity of a complex system to enact a world.[11](#11_14) 

There are many forms ofcoupling that we could provide for our rings. Let us suppose, though, that wesimply drop the ring into a milieu of random 0s and 1s, much like a cell thatis plunged into a chemical milieu. Imagine further that when one of the cellsof this automata encounters one of these two alternatives (0s and 1s), thestate of the cell is replaced by the perturbation that it encountered (see [figure 8.1](#fig_001_4)).For the sake of brevity, let us give the name Bittorioto this particular ring of cellular automata having this form of structuralcoupling with the chosen milieu. 

![9739_008_fig_001.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image037.png)

In [figure 8.2](#fig_002_3), the arrow to theleft indicates the moment where one perturbation reaches one particular cell atone particular instant. The dynamics that follow indicate the ensuing change(or lack of it), that is, the way in which Bittorio compensates for thisperturbation. If Bittorio’s rule belongs to the first or fourth class (a simpleor a chaotic attractor), then the consequence of the perturbation is simplyinvisible: Bittorio either goes back to its previous homogenous state, or itremains in a randomlike state. 

![9739_008_fig_002.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image039.png)

[Figure 8.2](#fig_002a_3) Bittorio’s lifehistory showing changes in this history depending on the perturbations itencounters. 

It follows that only thesecond and third classes of rules can provide us with dynamics capable ofproducing interesting consequences for the kind of structural coupling we havechosen for Bittorio. As [figure 8.2](#fig_002_3)shows, for Bittorios with these rules a single perturbation induces a changefrom one to another spatiotemporal configuration. Both of these configurationsare stable and distinguishable. 

The case of Bittorio ofrule 10010000, illustrated in [figure 8.3](#fig_003_3), is worth commenting on in more detail. As can be seen, the encounter with just oneperturbation changes the spatial periodicities from one to another stableconfiguration. But a second perturbation at the same cell undoes the previouschange. Hence any odd sequence of perturbations at the same locus will lead toa change in state configuration for Bittorio, whereas any even sequence ofperturbations will be invisible since it leaves Bittorio unchanged. Thus of allthe innumerable sequences of possible perturbations, this Bittorio picks up orsingles out from the milieu a very specific subset, namely, finite oddsequences, since only these sequences induce a repeatable change in Bittorio’sconfiguration. In other words, given its rule and given its form of structuralcoupling, this Bittorio becomes an “odd sequence recognizer.” 

![9739_008_fig_003.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image041.png)

Another example of suchemergent significations is shown in [figure 8.4](#fig_004_3) for Bittorio of rule01101110. Here a sequence of two perturbations is the only trigger capable ofleading to a change in the state configuration of Bittorio. This is readilyseen in [figure 8.4](#fig_004_3) where wehave superimposed several encounters at different cellular loci to facilitatecomparison. Anything other than double perturbations in one location leavesthis Bittorio unchanged. 

![9739_008_fig_004.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image043.png)

[Figure 8.4](#fig_004a_3) A Bittorioresponsive to a sequence of double perturbations. 

Other explorations withsimultaneous perturbations and more complex forms of structural coupling revealmore rich and interesting behaviors for these Boolean cellular automata. Theabove examples, however, are enough for the purposes of illustration here. 

We wish to emphasizethat in these two specific cases ([figures8.3](#fig_003_3) and [8.4](#fig_004_3)) wehave not provided Bittorio with a program to distinguish “odd sequences” or“two successive perturbations.” Instead we have specified, on the one hand, aform of closure for the system (the network’s internal dynamical emergences)and, on the other hand, the way in which this system will couple with a givenmilieu (replacement of the state of each cell with the perturbation itencounters in a milieu of random 0s and 1s). The result, however, is that overtime this coupling selects or enacts from a world of randomness a domain ofdistinctions (“odd sequences” or “two successive perturbations”) that hasrelevance for the structure of the system. In other words, on the basis of itsautonomy the system selects or enacts a domain of significance. 

We use these words significance and relevanceadvisedly, for they imply that there is some kind of interpretation involved inthe encounters. In the case of Bittorio, this interpretation is obviously a farcry from the kinds of interpretation that depend on experience. Nevertheless,we can say that a minimal kind of interpretation is involved, where interpretation is understood widely to mean the enactmentof a domain of distinctions out of a background. Thus Bittorio, on the basis ofits autonomy (closure), performs an interpretation in the sense that it selectsor brings forth a domain of significance out of the background of its randommilieu. 

The distinctions thatBittorio selects, such as odd sequences, indicate the regularities with whichBittorio covaries. These regularities constitute what we could call Bittorio’sworld. It should be apparent that this world is not pregiven and then recoveredthrough a representation. We did not design Bittorio to be an odd sequencerecognizer; we simply provided Bittorio with certain internal dynamics and thendropped it into a random milieu. Nevertheless, given the history of coupling between the internal dynamics and the milieu, odd sequence becomes a significant distinction forBittorio. For this reason, we describe Bittorio’s world as enacted through ahistory of structural coupling. 

Bittorio provides, then,a paradigm for how closure and coupling suffice to bring forth a world ofrelevance for a system. Of course, this paradigm is rather simple. Ourintention, however, is not to provide a model of any specific phenomenon, andwe certainly do not intend to suggest that such a simple form of closure and couplingis sufficient for a system to experience a world. Rather, our intention issimply to provide a minimal example of how anautonomous system brings forth significance from a background. It is thesimplicity of the example that enables us to follow in detail the entireprocess by which a kind of distinction is enacted. 

Despite the simplicityof the example, we should not underestimate the moral it suggests. Since we canalready recognize the emergence of a minimal kind of significance with just thesimple form of autonomy (closure) and coupling given to Bittorio, imagine therich and complex kinds of significance that would be brought forth by livingcells or complex cellular networks, such as the brain and the immune system.Though far more complex and intricate, these systems nonetheless share withBittorio the properties of being autonomous (having operational closure) andbeing structurally coupled.[12](#12_12) 

Such autonomous systemsstand in sharp contrast to systems whose coupling with the environment isspecified through input/output relations. The digital computer is the mostfamiliar example of this latter kind of system. Here the meaning of a givenkeyboard sequence is always assigned by the designer. Living systems, however,are far from being in this category. Under very restricted circumstances we canspeak as if we could specify the operation of a cell or an organism throughinput/output relations. In general, though, the meaning of this or thatinteraction for a living system is not prescribed from outside but is theresult of the organization and history of the system itself. Let us now turn,then, to consider some actual living examples. 

## Color as a Study Case 

Perhaps the bestexample, one which we intend to explore in some depth here, is colorperception. We have two reasons for choosing to focus on color. First, thestudy of color provides a microcosm of cognitive science, for each disciplinein figure 1.1—neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics,and philosophy—has made important contributions to our understanding of color.Indeed, other disciplines, such as genetics and anthropology, have contributedas well. Second, color has immediate perceptual and cognitive significance inhuman experience. For these two reasons, color provides a paradigmatic domainin which our twin concerns of science and human experience naturally intersect.

For ease of expositionour discussion of color will proceed through several stages. We will firstdiscuss how colors themselves appear—what could be called the structure ofcolor appearance. We will then discuss color as a perceived attribute of thingsin the world. Finally, we will consider color as an experiential category. Letus emphasize that these stages are not found separately in experience; ourexperience is simultaneously shaped by all three. Theories of color do,however, tend to take as their point of departure one or the other of thesethree aspects. Thus our stages, though expository, are not arbitrary. 

### ColorAppearance 

Let us begin, then, notwith the visual system or with colored objects but simply with color itself.There are two important features of the structure of color appearance. First,all of the colors that we see can be described as some combination of six basiccolors: red, green, yellow, blue, black, and white. For example, orange is acombination of red and yellow; turquoise is a combination of blue and green;violet and indigo are combinations of red and blue, etc. Second, the appearanceof color varies along three dimensions, those of hue, saturation, andbrightness. Hue refers to the degree of redness,greenness, yellowness, or blueness of a given color. Red, green, yellow, andblue are the four fundamental or psychologically unique hues, which combine toform complex or psychologically binary hues. For example, red and yellowcombine to form reddish-yellows and yellowish-reds (oranges), whereas blue andred combine to form blueish-reds and reddish-blues (purples). For each uniquehue, there is another unique hue with which it cannot coexist to form a binaryhue. Thus red cannot coexist with green, and yellow cannot coexist with blue.Red and green are therefore known as opponent hues,as are blue and yellow. It should be noted that not every color need be of acertain hue. White and black, as well as the intermediate shades of gray, arecolors, but they have no hue. They are therefore known as achromaticcolors—colors that have zero hue—whereas colors with hue are called chromatic.The chromatic colors can also differ in the strength or saturationof their hue. Saturated colors have a greater degree of hue, whereasdesaturated colors are closer to gray. Brightness isthe final dimension of color appearance. Along this dimension, colors vary fromdazzling at one end to dim or barely visible at the other end. 

Why does color have thisstructure? Why, for example, are hues organized into pairs that are mutuallyexclusive or opponent? The model of color vision that takes as its point ofdeparture the structure of color appearance, and so attempts to answer thesequestions, is known as the opponent-process theory.This theory owes its origin to the research of the nineteenth-centuryphysiologist Ewald Hering but was proposed in its modern form by Leo Hurvichand Dorothea Jameson in 1957.[13](#13_13) According to this theory, thereare three color “channels” in the visual system: one channel is achromatic andsignals differences in brightness; the other two are chromatic and signaldifferences in hue. It should be noted that these channels are specified inpsychophysical experiments, not neurophysiological ones. The exact nature oftheir physiological embodiment is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, it isaccepted that the channels correspond in some way to the complexcross-connections among retinal cells and postretinal neuronal ensembles. 

In the retina there arethree different but intermingled mosaics of cone cells, whose overlappingphotopigment absorption curves peak around 560, 530, and 440 nanometersrespectively. These three cone mosaics constitute the so-called long-wave (L),middle-wave (M), and short-wave (S) receptors. Excitatory and inhibitoryprocesses in postreceptoral cells enable the signals from these receptors to beadded and/or subtractively compared. In the opponent-process model, theaddition of the signals from all three receptors generates the achromatic(brightness) channel. The difference between the signals from the L and Mreceptors generates the red-green channel, and the difference between the sumof the signals from the L and M receptors and the signals from the S receptorsgenerates the yellow-blue channel. These two chromatic channels are opponent:an increase in red is always gained at the expense of green and vice-versa; anincrease in yellow is always gained at the expense of blue and vice-versa. 

This opponent-processtheory explains the structure of color appearance by showing how it resultsfrom the differential responses of the achromatic and chromatic channels. Thusthe organization of hues into mutually exclusive or antagonistic pairs reflectsan underlying opponent organization. We never experience any color to be acombination of red and green, or yellow and blue, because the chromaticchannels cannot simultaneously signal “red” and “green,” or “yellow” and “blue.”The opponent-process theory also explains why some hues are unique and othersare binary. Unique hues result from a signal from onechromatic channel while the other chromatic channel is neutral or balanced. Forexample, unique green results when the red-green channel signals “green” andthe yellow-blue channel is neutral so that it signals neither “yellow” nor“blue.” Binary hues, on the other hand, result from the interplay of the twochannels with each other. Thus orange results from the red-green channelsignaling “red” and the yellow-blue channel signaling “yellow.” 

Now that we have a basicunderstanding of how color appearance is generated, let us turn to the secondstage in our investigation, color as a perceived attribute of things in the world.

### Coloras a Perceived Attribute 

Since we perceive colorsto be spatially located, we might assume that the color we perceive an area tohave can be correlated with the light reflected locally from that area. Thus ifsome area looks whiter than another, it must be because more light is reflectedfrom the area. Or if some area looks green, it must be that the area reflectspredominantly middle-wave light. If we fail to see the area as green in such asituation, then our perception must be mistaken; what we see must be anillusion. 

If we examine thesituation more closely, however, we are in for interesting surprises. If weactually measure the light reflected from the world around us, we will discoverthat there simply is no one-to-one relationship between light flux at variouswavelengths and the colors we perceive areas to have. Suppose, for example,that we perceive some area to be green. Areas that look green typically reflecta high percentage of middle-wave light and a low percentage of long-wave andshort-wave light. We might suppose, then, that the area looks green because itreflects more middle-wave light to the eye. This supposition would be true,however, only in the limited case where the area is viewed in isolation, thatis, if we exclude everything else from the field of view. But when this area isviewed as part of a complex scene, it will continue to look green even if itreflects more long-wave and short-wave light than middle-wave light. In otherwords, when the area is viewed as part of a complex scene, the light that itlocally reflects is not sufficient to predict its perceived color. Therefore,there simply is no one-to-one correspondence between perceived color andlocally reflected light. 

This relativeindependence of perceived color from locally reflected light has been known tovision scientists for quite some time.[14](#14_13)The independence is manifested in two complementary phenomena. In the first,the perceived colors of things remain relatively constant despite large changesin the illumination. This phenomenon is known as approximatecolor constancy. In the second, two areas that reflect light of the samespectral composition can be seen to have different colors depending on thesurroundings in which they are placed. This phenomenon is known as simultaneous color contrast or chromaticinduction.[15](#15_12) 

These two phenomenaforce us to conclude that we cannot account for our experience of color as anattribute of things in the world by appealing simply to the intensity andwavelength composition of the light reflected from an area. Instead, we need toconsider the complex and only partially understood processes of cooperative comparisonamong multiple neuronal ensembles in the brain, which assign colors to objectsaccording to the emergent, global states they reach given a retinal image. 

Consider the followinginteresting demonstration. We take two identical slide projectors superimposedover a common screen and fit each with identical copies of a slide containing acheckerboard of grays, whites, and blacks. The two slides are superimposed sothat they are exactly aligned. We also put a red filter in one of theprojectors, so that the overall pattern that results is an array of pinks ofdifferent saturations. Let us now turn one slide by 90 degrees. The result is afull, multicolored image, containing small squares that are yellow, blue, andgreen, as well as red and pink.[16](#16_13) 

The effect of this experiment is quite dramatic: a multicolored imagearises where physics would lead us to expect only various shades of pink. Thischromatic effect can be described by the white-to-white and red-to-red ratiosacross the edges of the small squares accomplished by the rotation of one ofthe slides. How can this happen? 

As we mentioned whendiscussing the opponent-process theory, the light that reaches the eye perturbsthree different but intermingled mosaics of cones, which constitute threeretinal surfaces: the S, M, and L receptors. These three retinal surfaces areby no means identical or homogenous. For example, the L receptor has a densityof cones about five times higher than the S receptor and slightly less than theM receptor. Furthermore, due to the inner connectivity of the retina, localdifferences of activity in the three receptor surfaces depend on what happensin the rest of the retina. In this manner, internal relativevalues are generated. Abrupt deviations from such reference values in the locallevels of activity become the difference that makes a difference: within theboundaries of such deviations a uniform color is perceived. 

This descriptionhighlights the emergent configurations at the retinal level and so is onlypartial. There are structures at all levels of the visual pathways thatparticipate in the perception of color. In primates, the participation ofsubensembles of neurons in color perception has been demonstrated in thethalamus (LGN), primary and extrastriate visual cortex, inferotemporal cortex,and frontal lobes.[17](#17_11) Most notable is a collection ofneurons in the so-called area V4 of the extrastriate cortex where evenindividual neuronal responses can be roughly associated with the colorconstancies of a visual field.[18](#18_11) These neuronal structuresconstitute a color subnetwork—a sort of perceptual “agent,” to use Minsky’sterminology. Thus nothing short of a large and distributed neuronal network isinvolved in our perception of color. 

Colors are not, ofcourse, perceived in isolation from other attributes, such as shape, size,texture, motion, and orientation. For example, the artist Kandinsky commentedon the relation between color and motion. In one of his essays he wrote, “Iftwo circles are drawn and painted respectively yellow and blue, a briefcontemplation will reveal in the yellow a spreading movement out from thecenter, and a noticeable approach to the spectator. The blue, on the otherhand, moves into itself, like a snail retreating into its shell, and draws awayfrom the spectator. The eye feels stung by the first circle while it isabsorbed into the second.”[19](#19_11) 

The motion thatKandinsky refers to here is obviously not movement in the physical space of thepicture. It is, rather, motion in our perceptual space. As Mark Johnson notesin a discussion of this passage from Kandinsky, “The ‘movement’ refers tostructures in our perceptual interaction, in which we form unified images andtrace out relations among the various elements in the work.”[20](#20_11) 

Recent trends inphysiology enable us to understand the bodily basis for these “structures ofperceptual interaction.” In recent years physiology has moved toward the studyof vision as a patchwork of visual modalities, including at least form (shape,size, rigidity), surface properties (color, texture, specular reflectance,transparency), three-dimensional spatial relationships (relative positions,three-dimensional orientation in space, distance), and three-dimensionalmovement (trajectory, rotation). It has become evident that these differentvisual modalities are emergent properties of concurrent subnetworks, which havea degree of independence and even anatomical separability but cross-correlateand work together so that at almost every moment a visual percept is coherent.[21](#21_11) (This kind of architecture is,once again, strongly reminiscent of Minsky’s societies of agents.) [Figure 8.5](#fig_005_2)depicts some of the identified anatomical elements of these visual subnetworks.Among the modalities, color seems to be one of the more simple, for colorindicators can be obtained solely on the basis of luminance and contrastlevels. This simplicity betrays, however, the equally important fact that coloris always perceived within a more encompassing visual context. All of thesubnetworks work cooperatively; we never see color as an isolated item.

[Figure 8.5](#fig_005a_2) Parallel streams inthe visual pathway. From DeYoe and Van Essen, Concurrent processing streams inmonkey visual cortex. 

Furthermore, visualperception is in active exchange with other sensory modalities. For example,the associations of color and sound, as well as color and horizontal/verticalperception (involving the sense of orientation and equilibrium), are well knownto artists, though less studied by neurobiologists. Beyond these intermodalrelations there are, of course, varieties of cognitive expectancies andmemories. Such “top-down” dependency is to be expected, for, like those of theLGN and visual cortex, the pathways depicted in [figure 8.5](#fig_005_2) are all bidirectional. Thus, to reiterateone of our central points, the neuronal network does not function as a one-waystreet from perception to action. Perception and action, sensorium and motorium,are linked together as successively emergent and mutually selecting patterns. 

To bring home this pointthat color perception partakes of both other visual and sensory modalities, letus consider a much more dramatic example: the complete loss of colorperception. In a recent article Oliver Sacks and Robert Wasserman presented anaccount of a patient who, due to an accident, became completely color-blind.[22](#22_11) This particular case of so-calledacquired cerebral achromatopsia is fascinating because it occurred in an artistknown for his especially colorful, abstract paintings. As a result of a caraccident, this person—referred to as “Mr. I”—could no longer perceive anycolors: he lived in a visual world that resembled black-and-white television. 

The participation ofcolor perception in other modalities of experience is evident from Mr. I’sdescriptions in the weeks following his accident. Because of the absence ofcolor, the overall character of his experience changed dramatically: everythinghe saw “had a distasteful, ‘dirty’ look, the whites glaring, yet discolored andoff-white, the blacks cavernous—everything wrong, unnatural, stained, andimpure.”23 As a result, hefound foods disgusting and sexual intercourse impossible. He could no longervisually imagine colors, nor could he dream in color. His appreciation of musicwas also impaired, for he could no longer experience musical tones bysynestheticly transforming them into plays of color. Eventually, Mr. I seemedto forget completely his former world of color. His habits, behavior, andactions changed as he became progressively more of a “night person.” In hiswords, “I love the nighttime. … I often wonder about people who work at night.They never see the sunlight. They prefer it. … It’s a different world: there’sa lot of space—you’re not hemmed in by streets, people. … It’s a whole newworld. Gradually I am becoming a night person. At one time I felt kindly towardcolor, very happy about it. In the beginning, I felt very bad, losing it. Now Idon’t even know it exists—it’s not even a phantom.”[24](#24_9)

This descriptionprovides rare insight into how our perceived world, which we usually take forgranted, is constituted through complex and delicate patterns of sensorimotoractivity. Our colored world is brought forth by complex processes of structuralcoupling. When these processes are altered, some forms of behavior are nolonger possible. One’s behavior changes as one learns to cope with newconditions and situations. And, as one’s actions change, so too does one’ssense of the world. If these changes are dramatic enough—as in Mr. I’s loss ofcolor—then a different perceived world will be enacted. 

The preceding exampleshave shown us how color as an attribute is intimately involved with otherattributes of our perceived world. Our examination so far shows that we willnot be able to explain color if we seek to locate it in a world independent ofour perceptual capacities. Instead, we must locate color in the perceived orexperiential world that is brought forth from our history of structuralcoupling. Indeed, this point will become even more apparent when we considercolor as an experiential category. Before we turn to this third stage in ourdiscussion of color, however, let us pause to consider an objection. 

### WhereIs Color? 

Suppose someone, inreply to our discussion, were to demand, “What is the point of all these complexneuronal processes if not to compensate for the changes in illumination andrecover some stable feature of objects? Consider, for example, the surfacereflectance of an object. This property corresponds to the percentage ofincident light at each wavelength that an object reflects. This percentage orratio describes the way in which an object, by virtue of its physicalconstitution, alters the ambient light; it is therefore a stable property, onethat remains constant through changes in illumination. Why not say, then, thatalthough we must account for color experience by revealing its constitutionthrough emergent patterns of neuronal activity, this experience is nonethelessa result of having to solve the information-processing problem of recovering surfacereflectance?” 

Recent computationalmodels of color vision seem to support this line of argument. The surfacereflectances of objects in our surrounding world, such as bricks, grass,buildings, etc., can be expressed in a rather limited (three-dimensional) setof prototypical functions.[25](#25_9) Thus it would seem that all thevisual system has to do is sample the scene with its three color channels andthereby reconstitute the surface reflectances from the activity in thesechannels. On the basis of these models, several vision scientists, as well ascertain philosophers, have argued not only that the function of color vision isthe recovery of surface reflectance but also that color itself is just the propertyof surface reflectance.[26](#26_9) 

This objectivistproposal gives rise to several considerable problems, which serve to reinforceour point that the colors we see must be located not in a pregiven world butrather in the perceived world brought forth from our structural coupling.Consider first the idea that color is just surface reflectance. We have alreadyseen that colors have certain properties and bear certain relations to eachother: color varies along the three dimensions ofhue, saturation, and brightness; hues are either unique or binary and areorganized into opponent pairs, etc. Now if color is just surface reflectance,we should be able to match these features of color with corresponding featuresof surface reflectance. But there are no such corresponding features. Surfacereflectances can be classified according to whether they reflect more or lesslight in the short-, middle-, and/or long-wave regions of the spectrum, butthey cannot be classified as being unique or binary, nor can they be classifiedas standing in opponent relations to other reflectances. Nor can theseproperties of uniqueness, binariness, and opponency be found in the structureof light. For these reasons, the properties that specify what colors are simplyhave no nonexperiential, physical counterparts.[27](#c8_note_27)

Second, color is notsimply a perceived attribute of surfaces; it is also a perceived attribute ofvolumes such as the sky. Furthermore, we experience colors as attributes ofafterimages and in dreams, memories, and synesthesia. The unity among thesephenomena is not to be found in some nonexperiential, physical structure butrather in color as a form of experience that is constituted through emergentpatterns of neuronal activity. 

Let us now consider theidea that the function of color vision is to represent and thereby recoversurface reflectance. The first thing to note about this idea is that it arisesnot from the biological and ecological investigation of color vision but fromthe engineering attempt to devise a system that will be able to detect objectsby discounting variations in the illumination and recovering the invariantreflectances in a scene. Although this engineering research program is ofconsiderable importance for our understanding of the more abstract principlesinvolved in vision, it should not be allowed to dictate conclusions about thebiological and ecological purposes that natural color vision serves. Indeed,attention to these biological and ecological purposes reveals that color visionis concerned as much with properties that change, such as lighting, weatherconditions, and time of day, as with properties that remain constant, such assurface reflectance.[28](#28_7) 

Finally, there is ahidden, but much deeper problem with the objectivist view of color vision: theobjectivist simply assumes that surface reflectances are to be found in somepregiven world that is independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities.But how are we to specify what counts as a surface? How are we to specify itsedges, boundaries, texture, and orientation, if not in relation to someperceiver for whom these distinctions are relevant? 

The objectivistsupposition that surface reflectances are pregiven rests on the assumption thatsince surface reflectance is a physical property, it can be measured andspecified in entirely physical terms. But although the reflectance at any pointin a scene can be specified in physical terms, what counts as a surface may infact involve tacit reference to a type of perceiver. This point is obscured incomputational models that emphasize the limited dimensions in which so-callednaturally occurring reflectances can vary. If we actually examine these models,we will see that the natural reflectances correspond not only to thereflectances of typical objects from our human environment, as opposed to theenvironments of considerably different visual creatures, but also that theseobjects have been picked out or specified prior to the actual task of vision.In other words, these models treat the visual system as if it were simplypresented with a certain class of prespecified objects whose reflectances mustthen be recovered. 

This approach involves aconsiderable and artificial simplification of our actual perceptual situation.The visual system is never simply presented with pregiven objects. On thecontrary, the determination of what and where an object is, as well as itssurface boundaries, texture, and relative orientation (and hence the overallcontext of color as a perceived attribute), is a complex process that thevisual system must continually achieve. This achievement, as we have seen inour discussion of the patchwork architecture of vision, results from a complexcooperative process involving active dialogue among all the visual modalities.Indeed, color vision is actually involved in the cooperative processes by whichthe visual scene comes to be segmented into a collection of surfaces. In thewords of P. Gouras and E. Zrenner, “It is impossibleto separate the object sensed from its color because it is the color contrastitself that forms the object.”[29](#29_6) Thus colors and surfaces gotogether: both depend on our embodied perceptual capacities. 

### Coloras a Category 

Our discussion so farhas concentrated on the perception of color, considered either on its own terms(color appearance), as it were, or as an attribute of things (surface colors,volume colors, etc.). But our experience of color is not only perceptual; it isalso cognitive: we organize all the various hue/saturation/brightnesscombinations that we perceive into a limited set of color categories and givenames to these categories. As we will now see, color categories provide yetanother dramatic illustration of how color is brought forth. 

#### Linguistic Aspects of Color 

Consider the numerousnames that we have in English for colors: red, yellow, orange, green, blue,purple, violet, indigo, pink, turquoise, aquamarine, mauve, chartreuse, etc.Given these many names, as well as the numerous names in other languages, wemight suppose that color categories are ultimately arbitrary, that is, thatnothing compels us to categorize colors in one way rather than another. Indeed,this view was at one time dominant within the fields of linguistics andanthropology.[30](#30_7) 

This view wasdramatically challenged in 1969 with the publication of a now classic work byBrent Berlin and Paul Kay.[31](#31_4) In this work, Berlin and Kayspecified a set of linguistic criteria for determining which color names in agiven language constitute “basic” color terms. These basic color terms name thebasic color categories in a given language. Then, in an examination of overninety languages, Berlin and Kay determined that there are at most eleven basiccolor categories encoded in any language, though not all languages encode alleleven. These basic categories are red, green, blue, yellow, black, white,gray, orange, purple, brown, and pink. Berlin and Kay also presented speakersof various languages with a standardized array of color chips and asked them tospecify both the boundaries and the best examples of the colors to which theirbasic terms refer. They found that although there was considerable variationamong speakers over color category boundaries, individuals virtually alwaysagreed on the best example of a color category. Furthermore, they found thatwhen several languages contained a common basic term, such as a basic term forblue, speakers virtually always agreed on the best example of the colorcategory no matter which language they spoke. Berlin and Kay argued thereforethat the basic color categories do not have a uniform structure, for somemembers of the categories are central and so constitute category “foci.” Sincethese central members are universally agreed upon, Berlin and Kay con­cludedthat “the eleven basic color categories are pan-human perceptual universals.”[32](#32_5) 

Although some languagesdo not encode all eleven basic color categories, we should not suppose that thecolor domain is impoverished for speakers of these languages. On the contrary,the set of basic color terms in a given language always encompasses the entirecolor space. For example, the language of the Dani tribe of New Guinea has onlytwo basic color terms. In studies of the Dani, Rosch (then Heider) showed thatthese two terms, which had previously been translated as “white” and “black,”were actually better translated as “white-warm” and “dark-cool,” for the formerterm covered white plus all the warm colors (red, yellow, orange,reddish-purple, pink), whereas the latter covered black plus all the coolcolors (blue, green).[33](#33_3) 

#### Colorand Cognition 

The studies we havediscussed so far have been about color language. There is an entire subfield inpsychology, called language and cognition, that considers and disputes the waysin which language and cognition may or may not be related. Prior to Berlin andKay, a well-known series of experiments had demonstrated that memory for colors(a cognitive variable) was a function of color naming (a linguistic variable).[34](#34_3) Since naming was assumed to beculturally relative, it was thus argued and widely accepted that cognition hadbeen demonstrated to be culturally relative. But what if both color languageand color cognition are functions of some third underlying factor—colorphysiology, for example? A natural laboratory for testing such questions wasprovided by the Dani of New Guinea since their language lacked virtually allcolor vocabulary. In a series of experiments, Rosch found that (1) centralmembers of basic color categories were perceptually more salient, could belearned more rapidly, and were more easily remembered in both short-term andlong-term memory than were peripheral colors, even by speakers of Dani who donot have names for the central colors; (2) the structures of the color spacesderived from Dani and English color naming were very different but were quitesimilar for those derived from Dani and English color memory; and (3) when Daniwere taught basic color categories, they found it quite easy to learncategories that were structured in the universal fashion (with central membersas central) but extremely difficult to learn categories that were structured ina deviant manner (with peripheral colors as central, where blue-green might becentral and blues and greens peripheral).[35](#35_3)Very similar effects were found in the development of color names in youngchildren in our own culture.[36](#36_3) All of these results arguedstrongly that both cognitive and linguistic aspects of color categorization arerelated to underlying (probably physiological) factors. Thus color categoriesappear to be a panhuman, species-specific universal. 

Our discussion so farwould seem to suggest that color categories are entirely determined by emergentpatterns of neuronal activity in the human visual system—the color subnetworkthat we reviewed above. Thus notice that the focal colors red, green, blue,yellow, black, and white can be mapped directly onto the responses of the threecolor channels in the opponent-process theory of color vision. But what aboutfocal orange, purple, brown, and pink? More recent research suggests thatdistinctly cognitive operations are required to generate these focal colors.The cognitive operations appear to be of two kinds: one is universal for ourspecies and the other is culture specific.[37](#37_1)

In 1978 Paul Kay andChad McDaniel provided a model of how color categories could be generated froma certain set of neuronal responses plus certain species-specific cognitiveprocesses.[38](#38_1) The neuronal responses correspondto the red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white responses of neuronal ensembles,such as those found by R. DeValois and G. Jacobs in the LGN of the macaque, aspecies of monkey that has color vision quite similar to ours.[39](#39_1)(One could also construct a model using the psychophysical color channels.Indeed, it is perhaps preferable to do so, since the exact neural embodiment ofthese channels is still disputed.) The cognitive processes correspond tooperations that can be modeled by using a branch of mathematics known as fuzzyset theory. Unlike standard set theory, fuzzy set theory operates with setsthat admit degrees of membership. Degree of membership in a set is specified bya function that assigns to each member of the set some value between 0 and 1.Thus for color, focal colors have degree of membership 1 in their respectivecategories, whereas nonfocal colors have degrees of membership between 0 and 1.In Kay and McDaniel’s model, the red-green, yellow-blue, and black-whiteneuronal responses directly determine the basic categories red, green, yellow,blue, black, and white. Orange, purple, brown, and pink, however, are“computed” or “generated” by cognitive operations on these neuronal responses.These cognitive operations correspond to the operation of fuzzy setintersection. Thus orange is the fuzzy intersection of red and yellow, purple of red and blue, pink of white and red,and brown of black and yellow. Since these categories require such cognitivederivations, Kay and McDaniel term them derived basiccolor categories. 

#### Color and Culture 

Finally, colorcategories depend on culture-specific cognitive processes. Thus in anotherstudy, Paul Kay and Willett Kempton found that the lexical classification ofcolors can affect subjective judgments of similarity among colors.[40](#40_1) For example, English containsterms for both green and blue, whereas Tarahumara (a Uto-Aztecan language ofnorthern Mexico) has a single term that means “green or blue.” This linguisticdifference appears to be correlated with a difference in subjective judgmentsof similarity among colors between speakers of the two languages: Englishspeakers tend to exaggerate the perceived distances of colors close to thegreen-blue boundary, whereas speakers of Tarahumara do not. 

Other evidence forculture-specific cognitive processes comes from R. E. MacLaury. He has foundthat purple is sometimes placed entirely within the cool range (blue-green) andother times on the boundary between the cool range and red and that brown issometimes placed within the yellow category and other times within black.[41](#41_1) MacLaury also reports that manyNative American languages of the Pacific Northwest encode an otherwise rare“yellow-with-green” basic category.[42](#42_1)

These examples show thatcolor categorization in its entirety depends upon a tangled hierarchy ofperceptual and cognitive processes, some species specific and others culturespecific. They also serve to illustrate the point that color categories are notto be found in some pregiven world that is independent of our perceptual andcognitive capacities. The categories red, green, yellow, blue, purple,orange—as well as light/warm, dark/cool, yellow-with-green, etc.—areexperiential, consensual, and embodied: they depend upon our biological andcultural history of structural coupling. 

We can now appreciate,then, how color provides a paradigm of a cognitive domain that is neitherpregiven nor represented but rather experiential and enacted. It is veryimportant to note that just because color is not pregiven does not mean that itdoes not exhibit universals or that it cannot yield to rigorous analysis by thevarious branches of science. Since color provides such a paradigm, we willreturn to it at various points. The time has come, however, to step back andconsider some of the lessons this cognitive domain provides for ourunderstanding of perception and cognition in general. 

## Cognitionas Embodied Action 

Let us begin, onceagain, with visual perception. Consider the question, “Which came first, theworld or the image?” The answer of most vision research—both cognitivist andconnectionist—is unambiguously given by the names of the tasks investigated.Thus researchers speak of “recovering shape from shading,” “depth from motion,”or “color from varying illuminants.” We call this stance the chicken position: 

Chickenposition: The world out there has pregivenproperties. These exist prior to the image that is cast on the cognitivesystem, whose task is to recover them appropriately (whether through symbols orglobal subsymbolic states). 

Notice how veryreasonable this position sounds and how difficult it is to imagine that thingscould be otherwise. We tend to think that the onlyalternative is the egg position: 

Eggposition: The cognitive system projects its ownworld, and the apparent reality of this world is merely a reflection ofinternal laws of the system. 

Our discussion of colorsuggests a middle way between these two chicken and egg extremes. We have seenthat colors are not “out there” independent of our perceptual and cognitive capacities.We have also seen that colors are not “in here” independent of our surroundingbiological and cultural world. Contrary to the objectivist view, colorcategories are experiential; contrary to the subjectivist view, colorcategories belong to our shared biological and cultural world. Thus color as astudy case enables us to appreciate the obvious point that chicken and egg,world and perceiver, specify each other. 

It is precisely thisemphasis on mutual specification that enables us to negotiate a middle pathbetween the Scylla of cognition as the recovery of a pregiven outer world(realism) and the Charybdis of cognition as the projection of a pregiven innerworld (idealism). These two extremes both take representation as their centralnotion: in the first case representation is used to recover what is outer; inthe second case it is used to project what is inner. Our intention is to bypassentirely this logical geography of inner versus outer by studying cognition notas recovery or projection but as embodied action. 

Let us explain what wemean by this phrase embodied action. By using theterm embodied we mean to highlight two points: first,that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having abody with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individualsensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassingbiological, psychological, and cultural context.[43](#43_1)By using the term action we mean to emphasize onceagain that sensory and motor processes, perception and action, arefundamentally inseparable in lived cognition. Indeed, the two are not merelycontingently linked in individuals; they have also evolved together. 

We can now give apreliminary formulation of what we mean by enaction.In a nutshell, the enactive approach consists of two points: (1) perceptionconsists in perceptually guided action and (2) cognitive structures emerge fromthe recurrent sensorimotor patterns that enable action to be perceptuallyguided. These two statements will perhaps appear somewhat opaque, but theirmeaning will become more transparent as we proceed. 

Let us begin with thenotion of perceptually guided action. We have already seen that for therepresentationist the point of departure for understanding perception is theinformation-processing problem of recovering pregiven properties of the world.In contrast, the point of departure for the enactive approach is the study ofhow the perceiver can guide his actions in his local situation. Since theselocal situations constantly change as a result of the perceiver’s activity, thereference point for understanding perception is no longer a pregiven,perceiver-independent world but rather the sensorimotor structure of theperceiver (the way in which the nervous system links sensory and motorsurfaces). This structure—the manner in which the perceiver is embodied—ratherthan some pregiven world determines how the perceiver can act and be modulatedby environmental events. Thus the overall concern of an enactive approach toperception is not to determine how some perceiver-independent world is to berecovered; it is, rather, to determine the common principles or lawful linkagesbetween sensory and motor systems that explain how action can be perceptuallyguided in a perceiver-dependent world.[44](#44_1)

This approach toperception was in fact among the central insights of the analysis undertaken byMerleau-Ponty in his early work. It is therefore worthwhile to quote one of hismore visionary passages in full: 

[The organism cannotproperly be compared to a keyboard on which the external stimuli would play andin which their proper form would be delineated for the simple reason that theorganism contributes to the constitution of that form. … “The properties of theobject and the intentions of the subject … are not only intermingled; they alsoconstitute a new whole.” When the eye and the ear follow an animal in flight,it is impossible to say “which started first” in the exchange of stimuli andresponses. Since all the movements of the organism are always conditioned byexternal influences, one can, if one wishes, readily treat behavior as aneffect of the milieu. But in the same way, since all the stimulations which theorganism receives have in turn been possible only by its preceding movementswhich have culminated in exposing the receptor organ to external influences,one could also say that behavior is the first cause of allthe stimulations. ]()

Thus the form of the excitant is created bythe organism itself, by its proper manner of offering itself to actions fromthe outside. Doubtless, in order to be able to subsist, it must encounter acertain number of physical and chemical agents in its surroundings. But it isthe organism itself—according to the proper nature of its receptors, thethresholds of its nerve centers and the movements of the organs—which chooses the stimuli in the physical world to which it willbe sensitive. “The environment (Umwelt)emerges from the world through the actualization or the being of theorganism—[granted that] an organism can exist only if it succeeds in finding inthe world an adequate environment.” This would be a keyboard which moves itselfin such a way as to offer—and according to variable rhythms—such or such of itskeys to the in itself monotonous action of an external hammer [italics added].[45](#45_1) 

In such an approach,then, perception is not simply embedded within and constrained by thesurrounding world; it also contributes to the enactment of this surroundingworld. Thus as Merleau-Ponty notes, the organism both initiates and is shapedby the environment. Merleau-Ponty clearly recognized, then, that we must seethe organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification andselection. 

Let us now provide a fewillustrations of the perceptual guidance of action. In a classic study, Heldand Hein raised kittens in the dark and exposed them to light only undercontrolled conditions.[46](#46_1) A first group of animals wasallowed to move around normally, but each of them was harnessed to a simplecarriage and basket that contained a member of the second group of animals. Thetwo groups therefore shared the same visual experience, but the second groupwas entirely passive. When the animals were released after a few weeks of thistreatment, the first group of kittens behaved normally, but those who had beencarried around behaved as if they were blind: they bumped into objects and fellover edges. This beautiful study supports the enactive view that objects arenot seen by the visual extraction of features but rather by the visual guidanceof action. 

Lest the reader feelthat this example is fine for cats but removed from human experience, consideranother case. Bach y Rita has designed a video camera for blind persons thatcan stimulate multiple points in the skin by electrically activated vibration.[47](#47_1) Using this technique, imagesformed with the camera were made to correspond to patterns of skin stimulation,thereby substituting for the visual loss. Patterns projected on to the skinhave no “visual” content unless the individual is behaviorally active bydirecting the video camera using head, hand, or body movements. When the blindperson does actively behave in this way, after a few hours of experience aremarkable emergence takes place: the person no longer inteprets the skinsensations as body related but as images projected into the space beingexplored by the bodily directed “gaze” of the video camera. Thus to experience“real objects out there,” the person must actively direct the camera (by heador hand). 

Another sensory modalitywhere the relation between perception and action can be seen is olfaction. Overmany years of research, Walter Freeman has managed to insert an array ofelectrodes into the olfactory bulb of a rabbit so that a small portion of theglobal activity can be measured while the animal behaves freely.48 He found thatthere is no clear pattern of global activity in the bulb unless the animal isexposed to one specific odor several times. Furthermore, such emergent patternsof activity seem to be created out of a background of incoherent or chaoticactivity into a coherent attractor.[49](#49_1)As in the case of color, smell is not a passive mapping of external featuresbut a creative form of enacting significance on the basis of the animal’sembodied history. 

There is in fact growingevidence that this kind of fast dynamics can underlie the configuration ofneuronal ensembles. It has been reported in the visual cortex in cats andmonkeys linked to visual stimulation; it has been found in radically differentneural structures such as the avian brain and even the ganglia of aninvertebrate, Hermissenda.[50](#50_1)This universality is important, for it indicates the fundamental nature of thiskind of mechanism of sensorimotor coupling and hence enaction. Had this kind ofmechanism been a more species-specific process, typical of, say, only themammalian cortex, it would have been far less convincing as a working hypothesis.[51](#51_1) 

Let us now turn to theidea that cognitive structures emerge from the kinds of recurrent sensorimotorpatterns that enable action to be perceptually guided. The pioneer and giant inthis area is Jean Piaget.[52](#52_1) Piaget laid out a program that hecalled genetic epistemology: he set himself the taskof explaining the development of the child from an immature biological organismat birth to a being with abstract reason in adulthood. The child begins withonly her sensorimotor system, and Piaget wishes to understand how sensorimotorintelligence evolves into the child’s conception of an external world withpermanent objects located in space and time and into the child’s conception ofherself as both an object among other objects and as an internal mind. WithinPiaget’s system, the newborn infant is neither an objectivist nor an idealist;she has only her own activity, and even the simplest act of recognition of anobject can be understood only in terms of her own activity. Out of this, shemust construct the entire edifice of the phenomenal world with its laws andlogic. This is a clear example in which cognitive structures are shown toemerge from recurrent patterns (in Piaget’s language, “circular reactions”) ofsensorimotor activity. 

Piaget, however, as atheorist, never seems to have doubted the existence of a pregiven world and anindependent knower with a pregiven logical endpoint for cognitive development.The laws of cognitive development, even at the sensorimotor stage, are anassimilation of and an accommodation to that pregiven world. We thus have aninteresting tension in Piaget’s work: an objectivist theorist who postulateshis subject matter, the child, as an enactive agent, but an enactive agent whoevolves inexorably into an objectivist theorist. Piaget’s work, alreadyinfluential in some domains, would bear more attention from non-Piagetians. 

One of the mostfundamental cognitive activities that all organisms perform is categorization.By this means the uniqueness of each experience is transformed into the morelimited set of learned, meaningful categories to which humans and otherorganisms respond. In the behaviorist era of psychology (which was also theheyday of cultural relativism in anthropology), categories were treated asarbitrary, and categorization tasks were used in psychology only to study thelaws of learning.[53](#53_1) (The sense of arbitrariness alsoreflects the subjectivist trends in contemporary thought that emphasize theelement of interpretation in all experience.) In the enactive view, althoughmind and world arise together in enaction, their manner of arising in any particularsituation is not arbitrary. Consider the object on which you are sitting, andask yourself what it is. What is its name? If you are sitting on a chair, thechances are that you will have thought chair ratherthan furniture or armchair.Why? Rosch proposed that there was a basic level of categorization intaxonomies of concrete objects at which biology, culture, and cognitive needsfor informativeness and economy all met.[54](#54_1)In a series of experiments, Rosch et al. found the basic level ofcategorization to be the most inclusive level at whichcategory members (1) are used, or interacted with, by similar motor actions,(2) have similar perceived shapes and can be imaged, (3) have identifiablehumanly meaningful attributes, (4) are categorized by young children, and (5)have linguistic primacy (in several senses).[55](#55_1)

The basic level ofcategorization, thus, appears to be the point at which cognition andenvironment become simultaneously enacted. The object appears to the perceiveras affording certain kinds of interactions, and the perceiver uses the objectswith his body and mind in the afforded manner. Form and function, normallyinvestigated as opposing properties, are aspects of the same process, andorganisms are highly sensitive to their coordination. And the activitiesperformed by the perceiver/actor with basic-level objects are part of thecultural, consensually validated forms of the life of the community in whichthe human and the object are situated—they are basic-level activities. 

Mark Johnson proposedanother very intriguing basic categorization process.[56](#56_1)Humans, he argues, have very general cognitive structures called kinesthetic image schemas: for example, the container schema, the part-whole schema,and the source-path-goal schema. These schemasoriginate in bodily experience, can be defined in terms of certain structuralelements, have a basic logic, and can be metaphorically projected to givestructure to a wide variety of cognitive domains. Thus, the container schema’sstructural elements are “interior, boundary, exterior,” its basic logic is“inside or outside,” and its metaphorical projection gives structure to ourconceptualizations of the visual field (things go in and out of sight),personal relationships (one gets in or out of a relationship), the logic ofsets (sets contain their members), and so on. 

On the basis of adetailed study of these kinds of examples, Johnson argues that image schemasemerge from certain basic forms of sensorimotor activities and interactions andso provide a preconceptual structure to our experience. He argues that since ourconceptual understanding is shaped by experience, we also have image-schematicconcepts. These concepts have a basic logic, which imparts structure to thecognitive domains into which they are imaginatively projected. Finally, theseprojections are not arbitrary but are accomplished through metaphorical andmetonymical mapping procedures that are themselves motivated by the structuresof bodily experience. Sweetzer provides specific case studies of this processin linguistics. She argues that historical changes of meaning of words inlanguages can be explained as metaphorical extensions from the concrete andbodily relevant senses of basic-level categories and image schemas to moreabstract meanings—for example, “to see” comes to mean “to understand.”[57](#57_1) 

Focusing oncategorization, Lakoff has written a compendium of the work that various peoplehave done that can be interpreted to challenge an objectivist viewpoint.[58](#58_1) Recently Lakoff and Johnson haveproduced a manifesto of what they call an experientialist approach tocognition. This is the central theme of their approach: 

Meaningful conceptual structures arise from two sources: (1) from thestructured nature of bodily and social experience and (2) from our innatecapacity to imaginatively project from certain well-structured aspects ofbodily and interactional experience to abstract conceptual structures. Rationalthought is the application of very general cognitive processes—focusing,scanning, superimposition, figure-ground reversal, etc.—to such structures.[59](#59_1) 

This statement wouldseem consonant with the view of cognition as enaction for which we are arguing.

One provocative possibleextension of the view of cognition as enaction is to the domain of culturalknowledge in anthropology. Where is the locus of cultural knowledge such asfolktales, names for fishes, jokes—is it in the mind of the individual? In therules of society? In cultural artifacts? How can we account for the variationfound across time and across informants?[60](#60_1)Great leverage for anthropological theory might beobtained by considering the knowledge to be found in the interface betweenmind, society, and culture rather than in one or even in all of them. Theknowledge does not preexist in any one place or form but is enacted inparticular situations—when a folktale is told or a fish named. We leave it toanthropology to explore this possibility. 

### HeideggerianPsychoanalysis 

A view ofpsychopathology fundamentally different from either the Freudian approach orobject relations theory was offered by Karl Jaspers, Ludwig Binswagner, andMerleau-Ponty based on the philosophy of Heidegger.[61](#61_1)Intended to account for psychological disorders more general, morecharacterological, than the hysterical and compulsive symptomatology in whichFreudian analysis specializes, this account can be dubbed the ontological viewto contrast with Freud’s representational, cognitivist, epistemological view.[62](#62_1) In the ontological view, acharacter disorder can be understood only in terms of a person’s entire mode ofbeing in the world. A theme, such as inferiority and dominance, which isusually only one dimension among many used by an individual in defining hisworld, becomes fixated, through an early experience, such that it becomes theonly mode through which the person can experience himself in the world. Itbecomes like the light by which objects are seen—the light itself cannot beseen as an object—and thus there is no comparison possible with other modes ofbeing in the world.[63](#63_1) Existential psychoanalysis hasextended this type of analysis to pathologies other than character disorders atthe same time that it has recharacterized so-called pathologies as existentialchoices.[64](#64_1) 

The extent to which thisphenomenological portrait of pathology lacks any specific methods of its ownfor treatment is well known, however. The patient might attempt to recall theinitial incidents that produced the totalizing of one theme, enact and work throughthis theme through transference with the therapist, or undergo body work todiscover and alleviate the embodied stance of the theme—all, however, areequally characteristic of therapies in which the disorder is conceived in aFreudian, object relations, or other theoretical fashion. 

The possibilities fortotal personal reembodiment inherent in the mindful, open-ended approach toexperience that we have been describing may provide the needed framework andtools for implementation of an existential, embodied psychoanalysis. In fact,the relationship between meditation practice, Buddhist teachings, and therapyis a topic of great interest and great controversy among Westernmindfulness/awareness practitioners.[65](#65_1)Psychological therapy in the Western sense is a historically and culturallyunique phenomenon; there is no specific counterpart within traditionalBuddhism. Many Western meditators (whether they consider themselves students ofBuddhism or not) either are therapists or are considering becoming therapists,and many more have the experience of undergoing therapy. But again, we mustremind the reader of our disclaimer concerning what is said in this book aboutpsychoanalysis. An adequate discussion of this ferment would lead us too farafield at this point, but we invite the reader to consider what form areembodying psychoanalysis might take. 

## The Retreat into Natural Selection 

In preparation for thenext chapter, we now wish to take note of a prevalent view within cognitivescience, one which constitutes a challenge to the view of cognition that wehave presented so far. Consider, then, the following response to ourdiscussion: “I am willing to grant that you have shown that cognition is not simplya matter of representation but depends on our embodied capacities for action. Iam also willing to grant that both our perception and categorization of, say,color, are inseparable from our perceptually guided activity and that they areenacted by our history of structural coupling. Nevertheless, this history isnot the result of just any pattern of coupling; it is largely the result ofbiological evolution and its mechanism of natural selection. Therefore ourperception and cognition have survival value, and sothey must provide us with some more or less optimal fitto the world. Thus, to use color once more as an example, it is this optimalfit between us and the world that explains why we see the colors we do.” 

We do not mean toattribute this view to any particular theory within cognitive science. On thecontrary, this view can be found virtually anywhere within the field: in visionresearch, it is common both to the computational theory of Marr and Poggio[66](#66_1) and to the “direct theory” of J.J. Gibson and his followers.[67](#67_1) It is prevalent in virtuallyevery aspect of the philosophical project of “naturalized epistemology.”[68](#68_1) It is even voiced by those whoinsist on an embodied and experientialist approach to cognition.[69](#69_1)For this reason, this view can be said to constitute the “received view” withincognitive science of the evolutionary basis for cognition. We cannot ignore,then, this retreat into natural selection. 

Let us begin, onceagain, with our now familiar case study of color. The cooperative neuronaloperations underlying our perception of color have resulted from the longbiological evolution of the primate group. As we have seen, these operationspartly determine the basic color categories that are common to all humans. Theprevalence of these categories might lead us to suppose that they are optimalin some evolutionary sense, even though they do not reflect some pregivenworld. 

This conclusion,however, would be considerably unwarranted. We can safely conclude that sinceour biological lineage has continued, our color categories are viable or effective. Otherspecies, however, have evolved different perceivedworlds of color on the basis of different cooperative neuronal operations.Indeed, it is fair to say that the neuronal processes underlying human colorperception are rather peculiar to the primate group. Most vertebrates (fishes,amphibians, and birds) have quite different and intricate color visionmechanisms. Insects have evolved radically different constitutions associatedwith their compound eyes.[70](#70_1) 

One of the mostinteresting ways to pursue this comparative investigation is through acomparison of the dimensionalities of color vision. Our color vision is trichromatic: as we have seen, our visual system comprisesthree types of photoreceptors cross-connected to three color channels.Therefore, three dimensions are needed to represent our color vision, that is,the kinds of color distinctions that we can make. Trichromacy is certainly notunique to humans; indeed, it would appear that virtually every animal classcontains some species with trichromatic vision. More interesting, however, isthat some animals are dichromats, others are tetrachromats, and some may even be pentachromats.(Dichromats include squirrels, rabbits, tree shrews, some fishes, possiblycats, and some New World monkeys; tetrachromats include fishes that live closeto the surface of the water like goldfish, and diurnal birds like the pigeonand the duck; diurnal birds may even be pentachromats).[71](#71_1)Whereas two dimensions are needed to represent dichromatic vision, four areneeded for tetrachromatic vision (see [figure 8.6](#fig_006_1)),and five for pentachromatic vision. Particularly interesting are tetrachromatic(perhaps pentachromatic) birds, for their underlying neuronal operations appearto differ dramatically from ours.[72](#72_1)

![9739_008_fig_006.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image047.png)

[Figure 8.6](#fig_006a_1) Tetrachromatic vs.trichromatic mechanisms are illustrated here on the basis of the differentretinal pigments present in various animals. From Neumeyer, DasFarbensehen des Goldfisches. 

When people hear of thisevidence for tetrachromacy, they respond by asking, “What are the other colorsthat these animals see?” This question is understandable but naive if it istaken to suggest that tetrachromats are simply better at seeing the colors wesee. It must be remembered, though, that a four-dimensional color space isfundamentally different from a three-dimensional one: strictly speaking, the two color spaces are incommensurable, forthere is no way to map the kinds of distinctions available in four dimensionsinto the kinds of distinctions available in three dimensions without remainder.We can, of course, obtain some analogical insights into what such higherdimensional color spaces might be like. We could imagine, for example, that ourcolor space contains an additional temporal dimension. In this analogy, colorswould flicker to different degrees in proportion to the fourth dimension. Thusto use the term pink, for example, as a designator insuch a four-dimensional color space would be insufficient to pick out a singlecolor: one would have to say rapid-pink, etc. If itturns out that the color space of diurnal birds is pentachromatic (which isindeed possible), then we are simply at a loss to envision what their colorexperience could be like.[73](#73_1) 

It should now beapparent, then, that the vastly different histories of structural coupling forbirds, fishes, insects, and primates have enacted or brought forth differentperceived worlds of color. Therefore, our perceived world of color should notbe considered to be the optimal “solution” to some evolutionarily posed“problem.” Our perceived world of color is, rather, a result of one possibleand viable phylogenic pathway among many others realized in the evolutionaryhistory of living beings. 

Again, the response onthe behalf of the “received view” of evolution in cognitive science will be,“Very well, let us grant that color as an attribute of our perceived worldcannot be explained simply by invoking some optimal fit, since there is such arich diversity of perceived worlds of color. Thus the diverse neuronalmechanisms underlying color perception are not different solutions to the sameevolutionarily posed problem. But all that follows is that our analysis must bemade more precise. These various perceived worlds of color reflect variousforms of adaptation to diverse ecological niches. Each animal group optimallyexploits different regularities of the world. It is still a matter of optimalfit with the world; it is just that each animal group has its own optimal fit.”

This response is a stillmore refined form of the evolutionary argument. Although optimizations areconsidered to differ according to the species in question, the view remainsthat perceptual and cognitive tasks involve some form of optimal adaptation tothe world. This view represents a sophisticated neorealism, which has thenotion of optimization as its central explanatorytool. We cannot proceed further, then, without examining more closely this ideain the context of evolutionary explanations. We cannot attempt to summarize thestate of the art of evolutionary biology today, but we do need to explore someof its classical foundations and their modern alternatives.

They involve not only sensoryinterpretation and motor action but also the entire gamut of cognitiveexpectations and emotional tonality, which are central to the shaping of amoment of action. Between breakdown these oscillations are the symptoms of(rapid) reciprocal cooperation and competition among distinct agents that areactivated by the current situation, vying with each other for differing modesof interpretation for a coherent cognitive framework and readiness for action.On the basis of this fast dynamics, as in an evolutionary process, one neuronalensemble (one cognitive subnetwork) finally becomes more prevalent and becomesthe behavioral mode for the next cognitive moment.

# [9 ]()Evolutionary Path Making and Natural Drift 

## Adaptationism: An Idea in Transition 

The evolutionary themesthat we need to discuss actually run parallel to those we have pursued in ourdiscussion of cognition. We have seen that the notion of representation (in itsstrong version) is the centerpiece of most contemporary cognitive science.Similarly, the notion of adaptation is thecenterpiece for much of recent evolutionary biology. Many critiques of thisso-called adaptationist program have appeared inrecent years, however, resulting in a full-scale revision of what was, untilquite recently, a uniform view.[1](#1_19) 

The orthodoxy underrevision today is the theory of organic evolution in its neo-Darwinianformulation. Neo-Darwinism is to modern evolutionary theory what cognitivism isto cognitive science—in more ways than one. Like cognitivism, the neo-Darwinianprogram is relatively easy to state succinctly. 

The heritage from whichNeo-Darwinism arose was, of course, that of Darwin himself. This heritage canbe summarized in three basic points: 

1.   Evolution occurs as a gradualmodification of organisms by descent; that is, there is reproduction withheredity. 

2.  This hereditary materialconstantly undergoes diversification (mutation, recombination). 

3.  There is a central mechanism toexplain how these modifications occur: the mechanism of natural selection. Thismechanism operates by picking the designs (phenotypes) that cope with thecurrent environment most efficiently. 

This classical Darwinismbecame Neo-Darwinism during the 1930s as a result of the so-called modernsynthesis between the Darwinian ideas based on zoology, botany, and systematicson the one hand and the rising knowledge in cellular and population genetics onthe other. This synthesis established the basic view that modifications occurby small changes in organismic traits specified by heritable units, the genes.The genetic makeup responsible for the ensemble of traits leads to differentialreproduction rates, hence to changes in the genetic makeup of an animalpopulation over generations. Evolution simply is the totality of these geneticchanges in interbreeding populations. The pace and tempo of evolution aremeasured by the changes in the fitness of genes; thus it is possible to give aquantitative basis for the visible adaptation of animals to the environments inwhich they live. These concepts are, of course, ones with which we are allfamiliar. But we need to clarify them one step further to do justice to theirmultiple scientific roles. 

Consider the concept ofadaptation. The most intuitive sense of adaptation is that it is some form ofdesign or construction that matches optimally (or at least very well) somephysical situation. For example, the fins of fishes are well suited for anaquatic environment, whereas the ungulate hoof is well suited for running onthe prairies. Although this conception of adaptation is quite popular, mostprofessional evolutionary theorists do not construe adaptation in this way.Instead, adaptation has come to refer specifically tothe process that is linked to reproduction andsurvival, that is, to adapting. This process is—or soone supposes—what accounts for the apparent degree of adaptational designobserved in nature. 

To make this idea ofadapting do theoretical work, however, we need some way to analyze theadaptedness of organisms. This is where the notion of fitnesscomes in. From the vantage point of adaptedness, the task of evolution consistsin finding heritable strategies, sets of interrelated genes that will be moreor less capable of contributing to differential reproduction. When a genechanges so as to improve in this task, it improves its fitness. This idea offitness is often formulated as a measure of abundance.It is usually taken as a measure of individual abundance (as a measure of thesurplus offspring achieved), but it can also be construed as a measure of populationabundance (as the effect of genes on the rate of growth of a population). 

It has becomeincreasingly clear, however, that this way of measuring fitness as abundancehas a number of conceptual and empirical difficulties. First of all, in mostanimal groups reproductive success depends on sexual encounters with otherindividuals. Second, since the effects of any given gene are always intertwinedwith a multitude of other genes, it is not always possible to differentiate theeffects of individual genes. Third, the milieu where the genes are supposed toexpress themselves is enormously varied and time dependent. Finally, thismilieu must be seen in the context of the entire life cycle and ecology of ananimal. 

Fitness can also betaken as a measure of persistence. Here fitnessmeasures the probability of reproductive permanence over time. What isoptimized is not the amount of offspring but the probability of extinction.Clearly this approach is more sensitive to long-term effects, and so it is animprovement over the more narrow view of fitness as abundance. By the sametoken, however, it poses formidable problems at the level of measurement. 

Armed with theserefinements, the dominant orthodoxy in evolutionary thinking over the last fewdecades saw evolution as a “field of forces.”[2](#2_19)Selective pressures (the physical metaphor is fitting) act on the geneticvariety of a population, producing changes over time according to anoptimization of the fitness potential. The adaptationist or neo-Darwinianstance comes from taking this process of natural selection as the main factorin organic evolution. In other words, orthodox evolutionary theory does notdeny that there are a number of other factors operating in evolution; it simplydownplays their importance and seeks to account for the observed phenomenamainly on the basis of optimizing fitness. 

It is precisely thisorthodox, neo-Darwinian theory of evolution that is typically invoked orpresupposed in discussions of the relation between evolution and cognition andso constitutes the received view of evolution within cognitive science. Ourintention in this chapter is to embark upon a critical examination of thisorthodox view. It is important to make clear at the outset, however, that ourcriticisms will not be leveled at the scientific plausibility of theadaptationist program. It seems to us that this research program, likecognitivism, is as plausible as any other scientific enterprise. It cannot be refutedon purely logical grounds or on the basis of a few isolated observations. Wemust take some time, then, to explore the nature of the serious empiricaldifficulties that this orthodox theory faces, difficulties that have ledevolutionary biologists to enlarge their horizon to encompass alternativeaccounts and theories. 

In the next section wewill sketch some of the more important open questions and points of disputethat have motivated the development of these alternative accounts. Takentogether, these points will lead us toward a view of evolution that we shallrefer to as natural drift.[3](#3_18)Evolution as natural drift is the biological counterpart of cognition asembodied action, and therefore also provides a more embracing theoreticalcontext for the study of cognition as a biological phenomenon. 

## A Horizon of Multiple Mechanisms 

The points of disputethat we need to discuss are various and intermixed, but they all converge uponthe same fundamental limitation in the dominant interpretation of naturalselection. 

### Linkageand Pleiotropy 

Genes are clearly linkedtogether, and so it is not really possible—not even by some smart trade-off—totreat an organism as merely an array of characters or traits. The fact that thepresence of a gene does not result in the manifestation of an isolated trait,except in a few remarkable cases (such as eye color) is known to biologists as linkage and pleiotropy.Pleiotropic effects are not bizarre properties of a few exceptionally complextraits. Genic interdependence expresses the straightforward fact that thegenome is not a linear array of independent genes (manifesting as traits) but ahighly interwoven network of multiple reciprocal effects mediated throughrepressors and derepressors, exons and introns, jumping genes, and evenstructural proteins. In what other way could one even begin to explain thatthere is, for example, a genetic link between left-handedness and coeliacdisease (an intestinal irritability as a reaction to wheat protein resulting indiarrhea)?[4](#4_19) This linkage involves just aboutevery known metabolic pathway and organ operation in the body. 

Perhaps the mostdramatic cases of genomic wholeness (in macroevolution rather than ontogeny)are the drastic discontinuities in how species change over time, known as punctuated equilibria.[5](#5_19)This much-discussed idea has essentially dispensed with the idea ofevolutionary gradualism (that evolution occurs through the step-by-stepaccumulation of selected point mutations). The fossil record does not lookincomplete; intermediate forms often simply cannot be imagined. How, forexample, could one produce a transition from a species with dorso-ventralasymmetry to one with a mirror type of asymmetry? There are surely no organismsthat have all their organs collapsed in the midplane. Transitions must be amatter of global rearrangements involving cooperative effects and geneticexchanges. Such effects can be shown to appear in simple cases even in theabsence of any selection.[6](#6_18) 

Pleiotropy providesobvious difficulties for adaptationism. How can a gene be selectively optimizedif it has multiple effects, which need not increase fitness in the same manneror even in the same direction? Selection might push to decrease the frequencyof a certain gene, but pleiotropy, on the other hand, might push to increase ormaintain the gene. The net result is some compromise that cannot be describedas simply the result of selective pressures. 

As usual in science,such difficulties can be seen either as serious flaws or as details that willbe explained later. The confirmed neo-Darwinian acknowledges the existence ofgenetic interdependence but is confident that more refined techniques ofmeasurement will separate the contribution of pleiotropy from that of naturalselection, or that natural selection itself will decouple genes with oppositeeffects. Nonetheless, the fact remains that classical fitness measures of traitshave yet to provide any clear answer to the problem of pleiotropic effects. 

There are thereforereasons to ask whether the very program of studying evolution as trait fitnessoptimization is not fundamentally flawed. Instead, one could seek to studyevolution through a theoretical framework that puts a strong emphasis onorganisms and societies as integral wholes, rather than as arrays of traits—nomatter how many trade-offs one is willing to take into account.[7](#c9_note_7) 

### Development

The weakness of favoringan approach whose point of departure is a view of organisms as arrays ofindependent traits appears with renewed vengeance in considering the role ofdevelopment in the evolutionary process. The classical approach that is stillalive in most textbooks simply jumps from genes and gene frequencies tophenotypes and reproductively able organisms. The developmental stageconnecting birth to adulthood is acknowledged but immediately set aside.[8](#8_17) 

Evolutionary biologists,however, have been busy showing on their own terrain how pattern formation andmorphogenesis are highly constrained cellular choreographies that drasticallydelimit the scope of possibilities for change. In the words of a classic textby de Beer, “It has become increasingly clear from researches in embryologythat the processes whereby the structures are formed are as important as thestructures themselves from the point of view of evolutionary morphology andhomology.”[9](#9_19) 

Consider, for example,the development of the different segments in the embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila, a choice material for developmental studies(see [figure9.1](#fig_001_5)).[10](#10_18) The egg segments itselfsuccessively into committed regions giving rise to dorsal, ventral, etc. By anearly stage, the so-called blastoderm, there is a full-fledged epigenetic codefor the animal’s topography. This code defines a finite set of alternativedevelopmental decisions and a constrained set of transformations among them.For example, antennae and genitalia are quite close in this embryological grammar,a fact that coincides well with the significant number of so-called homeoticmutants that cause transformations in these distant points of the blastoderm.This model can be analyzed further through a distributed mechanism based onmorphogenetic gradients, in a manner that resembles the kind of analysispursued by connectionists. Indeed, the main point is the same: once again, onediscovers the importance of emergent properties in a complex network (whetherneural, genetic, or cellular). In the same manner, the stripes and patchcoatcolor of various mammals can be characterized by a constrained set of expectedpatterns. One example is a “spot” pattern that tends to transform distally to astripe pattern on narrowing regions such as tails.

[Figure 9.1](#fig_001a_5) Segmentation in theembryo of the fruit fly Drosophila. 

The point here is thatas embryological landscapes and genetic networks become more familiar, the mostpowerful explanatory accounts will appeal increasingly to the intrinsicself-organizing properties of such networks. These factors are, accordingly,referred to as intrinsic factors in evolution. Weshould note, however, that it is important to avoid the all-too-easy tendencyof opposing natural selection as external with developmental constraints asinternal, for this inner/outer dichotomy is not at all fruitful in attemptingto understand evolution. 

### RandomGenetic Drift 

Apart from pleiotropyand development, still another element confounds the basic logic of theadaptationist program. This is the irruption of randomness.It is widely recognized by now that there is a significant degree of random genetic drift (which is not to be confused with our idea ofevolution as natural drift) among the genetic compositions of animalpopulations. A first source of such randomness is the sheer effect ofproximity: if a gene is actively selected, it will bring along—in a“hitchhiking” effect—any others that are close enough. Since position inchromosomes is hardly linked to epigenetic effects, such proximity effects area considerable source of serendipity. 

Second, if a biologicalpopulation is maintained at a particular finite size, its gene and genotypefrequencies will “drift” from generation to generation. Such drift is due tothe fact that the genotype frequencies of parents, when filtered through thedifferential reproductive probabilities, may not be representative of thegenotype frequencies of the parents’ next generation. The next generation’sgene and genotype frequencies may diverge from those of the previous one.Therefore, even if one construes evolution as genotype changes (remember we areattempting to sketch an alternative), then evolution has occurred entirelyindependent of any selective pressure, due to what a statistician might call a“sampling error.” A number of observations have made clear that such drift isfar from marginal.[11](#11_16) Among these is the perplexingobservation that about 40 percent of the genome is not expressed and isrepetitive. This portion is accordingly known as “junk” DNA. From a classicalstandpoint, such a massive amount of genetic material is totally inactive andso simply should not be there. 

### Stasis 

Adaptation as a measureof increased progeny in a next generation might have virtually nothing to dowith long-range evolutionary permanence or with survival of an organismallineage. Zoologists are familiar with the widespread stasisof some groups—with the fact that groups not only stay around but remain withlittle changes, even though their environment has from our vantage pointchanged dramatically.[12](#12_14) 

For example, studies ofone of the more familiar groups among vertebrates, the salamanders of thefamily Plethodontidae, suggest that these organismshave persisted with little change for over fifty million years. Despite minorpigmentation and size differences, the species in this group are remarkablyuniform, especially in skeletal structure, which is the form best preserved inthe fossil record. In contrast, present members display considerable geneticdiversity in every parameter measured. All the terrestrial vertebrate generathat cooccurred with Plethodontidae sixty millionyears ago are now extinct. With regard to food sources and predator diversity,the environment has certainly changed dramatically. Yet the morphology of thisspecies has basically remained the same (though clearly the same morphology canaccommodate various different behaviors). 

Genotypic plasticity,which is at the base of evolutionary stasis, is also evident in the microbialworld where constant genetic exchange occurs side by side with an astoundingdegree of stasis. These and other observations suggest that focusing onpersistence, rather than abundance, might be a better way to approachadaptation. 

### Units of Selection 

The adaptationistprogram has also been criticized for its almost unquestioned assumption thatthe individual is the only unit of evolution and selection. In contrast,theories that emphasize multiple levels or units of selection working inparallel are entirely plausible and suggest revised interpretations of manyphenomena that have puzzled those who assume selection can operate only at theindividual level. At one extreme there is the selfish DNA hypothesis, whichviews genes themselves as the main units of selection.[13](#13_15) At the other extreme is theWynne-Edwards notion of group selection invoked to account for the maintenanceof altruistic traits.[14](#14_15) A full list of units looks ratherformidable: DNA short sequences, genes, whole gene families, the cell itself,the species genome, the individual, “inclusive” groups of genes that arecarried by different individuals, the social group, the actually interbreedingpopulation, the entire species (as a potentially interbreeding group), theecosystem of actually interacting species, and the global biosphere. Each unitharbors modes of coupling and selection constraints, has unique self-organizingqualities, and so has its own emergent status with respect to other levels ofdescription.[15](#15_14) 

We shall not attempt tosummarize this complex debate here—a debate that has proceeded so far by eachfavored level dismissing the other as nonsensical.[16](#16_15) Despite these partisan debates,the fact remains that future evolutionary theory will in one way or anotherinclude a clear articulation of various units of selection and their relations.

## Beyond the Best in Evolution and Cognition 

The above points ofcontention are sufficiently deep and critical to make the adaptationistapproach look considerably less compelling. Let us clearly state the crux ofthe matter: to explain an observed biological regularity as an optimal fit oroptimal correspondence with pregiven dimensions of the environment appears lessand less tenable on both logical and empirical grounds. As Richard Lewontinsaid in a recent critique of the classical position, “It is not that thesephenomena [developmental constraints, pleio­tropy, etc.] are not mentioned, butthey are clearly diversions from the big event, the ascent of Mount Fitness bySir Ron Fisher and his faithful Sherpas.”[17](#17_13) Increasingly, evolutionarybiologists have become engaged in a movement away from Mount Fitness toward alarger and as yet incompletely formulated new theory.[18](#18_13) Our task is to provide an outlinefrom our point of view of some of the main elements of this new emergingorientation. 

Evolutionary andcognitive issues coincide along at least two important lines, which areimplicitly active in cognitive science today: 

1.   Evolution is often invoked as anexplanation for the kind of cognition that we or other animals presently have.This idea makes reference to the adaptive value of knowledge, and it is usuallyframed along classical neo-Darwinian lines. 

2.  Evolution is often used as asource of concepts and metaphors in building cognitive theories. This tendencyis clearly visible in the proposal of so-called selective theories of brainfunction and learning. 

In either case, thecentral issue remains whether evolutionary processes can be understood by therepresentationist idea that there is a correspondence between organism andenvironment provided by the optimizing constraints ofsurvival and reproduction. Baldly stated, representationism in cognitive scienceis the precise homologue of adaptationism in evolutionary theory, foroptimality plays the same central role in each domain. It follows that anyevidence that weakens the adaptationist viewpoint ipso facto providesdifficulties for the representationist approach to cognition. 

In chapters 5 and 6 wedescribed how cognitive scientists were relentlessly led by the requirements oftheir research to the study of subnetworks that act on local scales. Thesenetworks interact with each other in tangled webs, forming societies of agents,to use Minsky’s language. It should be clear from our list of current problemsthat evolutionary theorists have reached independently much the sameconclusions. The constraints of survival and reproduction are far too weak to providean account of how structures develop and change. Accordingly, no global optimalfitness scheme apparently suffices to explain evolutionary processes. Thereare, to be sure, local genetic agents for, say, oxygen consumption or feathergrowth, which can be measured on some comparative scale where optimality may besought, but no single scale will do the job for all processes.[19](#19_13) 

The central issue can beput in the form of an analogy.[20](#20_13) John needs a suit. In a fullysymbolic and representationist world, he goes to his tailor who measures himand produces a nice suit according to the exact specifications of hismeasurements. There is, however, another obvious possibility, one that does notdemand so much from the environment. John goes to several department stores andchooses a suit that fits well from among the various ones available. Althoughthese do not suit him exactly, they are good enough, and he chooses the optimalone for fit and taste. Here we have a good selectionist alternative that usessome optimal criteria of fitness. The analogy admits, however, of furtherrefinement. John, like any human being, cannot buy a suit in isolation from therest of what goes on in his life. In buying a suit, he considers how his lookswill affect the response of his boss at work, the response of his girl friend,and he may also be concerned with political and economic factors. Indeed, thevery decision to buy a suit is not given from the outset as a problem but isconstituted by the global situation of his life. His final choice has the formof satisfying some very loose constraints (e.g., being well dressed) but doesnot have the form of a fit—and even less so of an optimal fit—to any of theseconstraints. 

With this third step inthe analogy we rejoin the types of issues being raised in evolutionary theory,as well as those in cognitive science, that involve the impossibility of simply“scaling up” from local solutions to overall performance. The analogy alsomoves us closer to the issues that have to be reformulated in a moreencompassing evolutionary theory. Let us now retake these issues in biologicaldetail. 

## Evolution:Ecology and Development in Congruence 

Part of the difficultyin moving beyond the adaptationist framework is to determine what to do afterwe abandon the idea of natural selection as the main explanation, so that everystructure, mechanism, trait, or disposition cannot be explained away by itscontribution to survival value. The temptation is to say, But then are thingsthere for no reason at all? The task in evolutionary biology is to change thelogical geography of the debate by studying the tangled, circular relations ofcongruence among the items to be explained. 

The first step is toswitch from a prescriptive logic to a proscriptive one, that is, from the ideathat what is not allowed is forbidden to the idea that what is not forbidden isallowed. In the context of evolution this shift means that we remove selectionas a prescriptive process that guides and instructs in the task of improvingfitness. In contrast, in a proscriptive context natural selection can be seento operate, but in a modified sense: selection discards what is not compatiblewith survival and reproduction. Organisms and thepopulation offer variety; natural selection guarantees only that what ensuessatisfies the two basic constraints of survival and reproduction. 

This proscriptiveorientation shifts our attention to the tremendous diversity of biologicalstructures at all levels. Indeed, one of the main points of modern biologicalthought is the way in which such a tremendous amount of diversity is not justcompatible with, but actually woven into, the basic constraint of maintaining acontinuous lineage. In fact, all the issues that we have discussed as problemsfor the adaptationist account become sources of explanation for alternativeviewpoints because they highlight the way in which the enormous diversity constantlygenerated at all levels in the genetic and evolutionary process both shapes andis shaped by the coupling with an environment. We have already seen repeatedlythat such emergent properties provide one of the main lessons from research inneuroscience and the study of self-organizing systems and nonlinear networks.Indeed, neurobiologists, developmental biologists, immunologists, and linguistsall find themselves in the position of trying to understand how so muchprofligacy is pruned to provide the substrata for various viable pathwaysrather than selected along trajectories to match a given external standard.[21](#21_13) 

The second step, then,is to analyze the evolutionary process as satisficing(taking a suboptimal solution that is satisfactory) rather than optimizing:here selection operates as a broad survival filter that admits any structurethat has sufficient integrity to persist.[22](#22_13) Given this point of view, thefocus of analysis is no longer on traits but rather on organismic patterns viatheir life history. Another metaphor recently suggested for this post-Darwinianconception of the evolutionary process is evolution as bricolage,the putting together of parts and items in complicated arrays, not because theyfulfill some ideal design but simply because they are possible.[23](#23_11) Here the evolutionary problem isno longer how to force a precise trajectory by the requirements of optimalfitness; it is, rather, how to prune the multiplicity of viable trajectoriesthat exist at any given point.[24](#24_11) 

One of the moreinteresting consequences of this shift from optimal selection to viability isthat the precision and specificity of morphological or physiological traits, orof cognitive capacities, are entirely compatible with their apparentirrelevance to survival. To state this point in more positive terms, much ofwhat an organism looks like and is “about” is completely underdeterminedby the constraints of survival and reproduction. Thus adaptation (in itsclassical sense), problem solving, simplicity in design, assimilation, external“steering” and many other explanatory notions based on considerations ofparsimony not only fade into the background but must in fact be completelyreassimilated into new kinds of explanatory concepts and conceptual metaphors. 

Let us now explicitlyarticulate the alternative to the view that we have been taking such pains tocriticize. The view that we call evolution by natural drift can be articulatedin four basic points: 

1.   The unit of evolution (at anylevel) is a network capable of a rich repertoire of self-organizingconfigurations. 

2.  Under structural coupling with amedium, these configurations generate selection, an ongoing process ofsatisficing that triggers (but does not specify) change in the form of viabletrajectories. 

3.  The specific (nonunique)trajectory or mode of change of the unit of selection is the interwoven(nonoptimal) result of multiple levels of subnetworks of selectedself-organized repertoires. 

4.  The opposition between inner andouter causal factors is replaced by a coimplicative relation, since organismand medium mutually specify each other. 

We intend this set ofarticulated mechanisms to replace the adaptationist outline that we presentedat the beginning of this chapter and to give content to our announcedalternative view. This view of evolution depends on the conjoint applicabilityof three conditions: 

1a. The richness of the self-organizing capacities in biologicalnetworks 

2a. A mode of structuralcoupling permitting the satisficing of viable trajectories 

3a. The modularity ofsubnetworks of independent processes that interact with each other by tinkering

These three conditionsare obviously not logically interdependent. Thus we can conceive of modularnetworks that couple with constraints requiring directed selection rather thansatisficing. Or we can conceive of rich networks that have histories ofsatisficing but are not modular and so do not manifest any developmentalqualities. It is therefore both interesting and remarkable that living organismsempirically satisfy these three conjoint conditions. This situation is not trueof systems in general; nor is it true as a matter of logic. It is true of thosekinds of beings that we are, namely, living systems. 

Since these ideas entaila change in our scientific views, they are of course subject to resistance.There are basically two points of resistance to the ideas presented here.First, there is resistance on the part of those who still feel close to theclassical viewpoint. Here we find a dismissal of the kinds of arguments that wehave unfolded in this chapter; they are claimed to be matters of minor detailor far-off clouds on the horizon waiting to be dispelled by more research.Second, there is a more pervasive and subtle form of resistance. Here we findagreement with our claim that evolutionary theory needs to undergo revision,yet a sufficient amount of the old view is retained, so that the revision isnot radical but merely cosmetic. In the present case, though (1a) is almostuniversally accepted in biology and cognitive science, (2a) and (3a) are stillminority positions. 

The difference for usbetween a merely partial change and the more thorough revision that we intendturns on how the notion of coupling with an environment is conceptualized. Ourclaim is that the logic of (1)–(3), when applied consistently, leads usinevitably to (4). Let us consider this issue more closely. 

According to traditionalwisdom, the environment in which organisms evolve and that they come to know isgiven, fixed, and unique. Here again we find the idea that organisms arebasically parachuted into a pregiven environment. This simplistic viewundergoes refinement when we allow for changes in the environment, an allowancethat was already empirically familiar to Darwin. Such a moving environmentprovides the selective pressures that form the backbone of neo-Darwinianevolutionary theory. 

In moving towardevolution as natural drift, however, we introduce a further step: we recastselective pressures as broad constraints to be satisfied. The crucial pointhere is that we do not retain the notion of an independent, pregivenenvironment but let it fade into the background in favor of so-called intrinsicfactors. Instead, we emphasize that the very notion of what an environment iscannot be separated from what organisms are and what they do. This point hasbeen made quite eloquently by Richard Lewontin: “The organism and theenvironment are not actually separately determined. The environment is not astructure imposed on living beings from the outside but is in fact a creationof those beings. The environment is not an autonomous process but a reflectionof the biology of the species. Just as there is no organism without anenvironment, so there is no environment without an organism.”[25](#25_11) 

The key point, then, isthat the species brings forth and specifies its own domain of problems to besolved by satisficing; this domain does not exist “out there” in an environmentthat acts as a landing pad for organisms that somehow drop or parachute intothe world. Instead, living beings and their environments stand in relation toeach other through mutual specification or codetermination. Thus what we describe as environmentalregularities are not external features that have been internalized, as representationism and adaptationism both assume.Environmental regularities are the result of a conjoint history, a congruencethat unfolds from a long history of codetermination. In Lewontin’s words, theorganism is both the subject and the object of evolution.[26](#26_11) 

We cannot emphasize thispoint too strongly, for the temptation in the movement toward anonadaptationist evolutionary view is to retain the organism and environment asseparate poles and then to attempt to determine the “proportion” that is playedby each—a bit of intrinsic factors plus a bit of external constraints. Thismode of breaking down the dynamics of evolution, however, simply will not do,for it forces upon us all the supposedly outdated problems of the innate versusthe acquired, nature versus nurture. But as Susan Oyama has so insightfullyanalyzed, this supposedly dead issue of nature versus nurture will actually refuseto go away unless we learn to see organisms and environments as mutuallyunfolded and enfolded structures.[27](#27_8)In Oyama’s words, 

Form emerges in successive interaction. Far from being imposed on matterby some agent, it is a function of the reactivity of matter at manyhierarchical levels, and of the responsiveness of those interactions to eachother. Because mutual selectivity, reactivity, and constraint take place onlyin actual processes, it is these that orchestrate the activity of differentportions of DNA, that make genetic and environmental influences interdependentas genes and gene products are environments to each other, as extraorganismalenvironment is made internal by psychological or biochemical assimilation, asinternal state is externalized through products and behavior that select andorganize the surrounding world.[28](#28_9) 

Genes are, then, betterconceived as elements that specify what in the environment must be fixed forsomething to operate as a gene, that is, to be predictably correlated with aresult. In every successful reproduction an organism passes on genes as well asan environment in which these genes are embedded. We see features of thisenvironment, such as sunlight or oxygen, as independent of the organism onlybecause our frame of reference is relative. The interconnectedness of theworld, however, says otherwise. Once again, the world is not a landing pad intowhich organisms parachute: nature and nurture stand in relation to each otheras product and process. 

What all this means is not that genes and environment are necessary forall characteristics, inherited or acquired (the usual enlightened position),but that there is no intelligible distinction between inherited (biological,genetically based) and acquired (environmentally mediated) characteristics …Once the distinction between the inherited and the acquired has beeneliminated, not only as extremes but even as a continuum, evolution cannot besaid to depend on the distinction. What is required for evolutionary change isnot genetically encoded as opposed to acquired traits, but functioningdevelopmental systems: ecologically embedded genomes.[29](#29_8)

Lewontin and Oyama areexemplary for their understanding of this crucial point. By and largebiologists have not thought through this point with the rigor and consistencyit demands. The reason, of course, is that if we take this mutual enfoldmentview of life and world seriously, it initially results in a sense of vertigodue to the collapse of what we had supposed to be sure and stable foundations.But rather than sweeping this sense of groundlessness under the rug by onceagain pitching the internal and the external against each other (which wealready know will not work), we need to delve deeper into this sense ofgroundlessness and follow through all of its implications, philosophically andexperientially. 

We should also take noteof recent theories that approach neural cognitive mechanisms in selectiveDarwinian terms.[30](#30_9) In our terms, these theoriesincorporate not just (1a) but also argue in various degrees for (2a) and (3a).Sometimes these so-called selectionist theories follow through the implicationsof these points to embrace the fully coimplicative nature of organism andenvironment. For example, Gerald Edelman, a leading exponent of suchselectionist theories, expressed to a reporter in a recent interview, “You andthe world are embedded together.”31 Nevertheless, it is not always clear to what extentselectionists are willing to let go of the objectivist convictions that oftenlinger in their writings. 

## Lessonsfrom Evolution as Natural Drift 

In the previous chapterwe argued that perception consists in perceptually guided action and thatcognitive structures emerge from the recurrent sensorimotor patterns thatenable action to be perceptually guided. We summarized this view by saying thatcognition is not representation but embodied action and that the world wecognize is not pregiven but enacted through our history of structural coupling.

We then raised anobjection in the form of the view that perceptual and cognitive processesinvolve various optimal adaptations to the world. It was this objection thatprompted our excursion into evolutionary biology in this chapter. What lessons,then, can we draw from this excursion? 

Let us return, onceagain, to our favored example of color. When we last left this cognitivedomain, we had seen that there are different, incommensurable “color spaces”:some require only two dimensions for their description (dichromacy), somerequire three (trichromacy), others require four (tetrachromacy), perhaps evenfive (pentachromacy). Each of these different kinds of color space is enactedor brought forth through a specific history of structural coupling. 

One of our motives inthis chapter has been to show how such unique histories of coupling can beunderstood from the vantage point of evolution. To this end, we have provided acritique of the adaptationist view of evolution as a process of (more-or-less) progressivefitness, and we have articulated an alternative view of evolution as naturaldrift. We claim, then, that these unique histories of coupling, which enactincommensurable kinds of color space, should not be explained as optimaladaptations to different regularities in the world. Instead, they should beexplained as the result of different histories of natural drift. Furthermore,since organism and environment cannot be separated but are in fact codeterminedin evolution as natural drift, the environmental regularities that we doassociate with these various color spaces (for example, surface reflectances)must ultimately be specified in tandem with the perceptually guided activity ofthe animal. 

Let us provide anotherexample from the comparative study of color vision. It is well known that honeybees are trichromats whose spectral sensitivity is shifted toward theultraviolet.[32](#32_7) It is also well known thatflowers have contrasting reflectance patterns in ultraviolet light. Considernow our “chicken-and-egg” question from the previous chapter: Which came first,the world (ultraviolet reflectance) or the image (ultraviolet sensitivevision)? Most of us would probably answer with little hesitation, The world(ultraviolet reflectance). It is therefore interesting to observe that thecolors of flowers appear to have coevolved with theultraviolet sensitive, trichromatic vision of bees.[33](#33_5)

Why should suchcoevolution occur? On the one hand, flowers attract pollinators by their foodcontent and so must be both conspicuous and yet different from flowers of otherspecies. On the other hand, bees gather food from flowers and so need torecognize flowers from a distance. These two broad and reciprocal constraintsappear to have shaped a history of coupling in which plant features and thesensorimotor capacities of bees coevolved. It is this coupling, then, that isresponsible for both the ultraviolet vision of bees and the ultravioletreflectance patterns of flowers. Such coevolution therefore provides anexcellent example of how environmental regularities are not pregiven but arerather enacted or brought forth by a history of coupling. To quote Lewontin oncemore, 

[Our central nervoussystems are not fitted to some absolute laws of nature, but to laws of natureoperating within a framework created by our own sensuous activity. Our nervoussystem does not allow us to see the ultraviolet reflections from flowers, but abee’s central nervous system does. And bats “see” what nighthawks do not. We donot further our understanding of evolution by general appeal to “laws ofnature” to which all life must bend. Rather, we must ask how, within thegeneral constraints of the laws of nature, organisms have constructedenvironments that are the conditions for their further evolution andreconstruction of nature into new environments.]()[34](#34_5) 

This insistence on thecodetermination or mutual specification of organism and environment should notbe confused with the more commonplace view that different perceiving organismssimply have different perspectives on the world. This view continues to treatthe world as pregiven; it simply allows that this pregiven world can be viewedfrom a variety of vantage points. The point we are making, however, isfundamentally different. We are claiming that organism and environment aremutually enfolded in multiple ways, and so what constitutes the world of agiven organism is enacted by that organism’s history of structural coupling.Furthermore, such histories of coupling proceed not through optimal adaptationbut rather through evolution as natural drift. 

The treatment of theworld as pregiven and the organism as representing or adapting to it is adualism. The extreme opposite of dualism is a monism. We are not proposingmonism; enaction is specifically designed to be a middle way between dualismand monism. The one example of a virtually monistic system that has beenproposed is the “ecological approach” of J. J. Gibson and his followers.[35](#35_5) It will be instructive to explorethe difference between our middle-way emphasis on the codetermination of animaland environment with the Gibsonian approach. Since this point is important, wewill conclude this section by taking several paragraphs to clarify thedifferences. 

Gibson’s theory hasessentially two distinct features. The first is compatible with our approach toperceptually guided action. Gibson claims that in the study of perception theworld must be described in a way that shows how it constitutes environments forperceiving animals. In Gibson’s view, certain properties are found in the environmentthat are not found in the physical world per se. The most significantproperties consist in what the environment affords for the animal, which Gibsoncalls affordances. Stated in precise terms,affordances consist in the opportunities for interaction that things in theenvironment possess relative to the sensorimotor capacities of the animal. Forexample, relative to certain animals, some things, such as trees, are climbableor afford climbing. Thus affordances are distinctly ecological features of theworld. 

Second, Gibson offers aunique theory of perception to explain how the environment is perceived. Heargues that there is sufficient information in the ambient light to specify theenvironment directly, that is, without the mediation of any kind ofrepresentation (symbolic or subsymbolic). In more precise terms, hisfundamental hypothesis is that there are invariances in the topology of theambient light that directly specify properties of the environment, includingaffordances. 

This second element—whichactually defines the Gibsonian research program—is not compatible with ourapproach to perceptually guided action. This point is easy to miss because bothapproaches deny the representationist view of perception in favor of the ideathat perception is perceptually guided action. In Gibson’s view, however,perceptually guided action consists in “picking up” or “attending to”invariances in the ambient light that directly specify their environmentalsource. For Gibson, these optical invariances, as well as the environmentalproperties they specify, do not depend in any way upon the perceptually guidedactivity of the animal (though Gibson’s followers do relativize them to a givenanimal niche).[36](#36_5) Thus Gibson writes, “Invariancecomes from reality, not the other way round. Invariance in the ambient opticarray over time is not constructed or deduced; it is there to be discovered.”37 Similarly, heclaims, “The observer may or may not perceive or attend to the affordance,according to his needs, but the affordance, being invariant is always there tobe perceived.”[38](#38_3) 

In a nutshell, then,whereas Gibson claims that the environment is independent, we claim that it isenacted (by histories of coupling). Whereas Gibson claims that perception isdirect detection, we claim that it is sensorimotor enactment. Thus theresulting research strategies are also fundamentally different: Gibsonianstreat perception in largely optical (albeit ecological) terms and so attempt tobuild up the theory of perception almost entirely from the environment. Ourapproach, however, proceeds by specifying the sensorimotor patterns that enableaction to be perceptually guided, and so we build up the theory of perceptionfrom the structural coupling of the animal. 

One other point deservesmention. It might be thought that perception as direct detection is compatiblewith the perceived world as enacted. The idea here would be that since ourperceived world is enacted through our history of coupling, it does not need tobe re-presented and so can be directly perceived. Some Gibsonians appear toargue for something resembling this idea when they claim that the “mutuality”of animal and environment grounds the notion of direct perception.[39](#39_3) Their idea is that given a properaccount of animal-environment mutuality, we do not need to invoke any kind ofrepresentational item (symbolic or subsymbolic) that would mediate or standbetween animal and environment; therefore, perception is direct. 

We believe that thisidea results from the mistaken assumption that animal-environment mutuality issufficient for direct perception. From the fact, however, that there is amutuality between animal and environment—or in our terms that the two arestructurally coupled—it simply does not follow that the act of perceiving isdirect in the Gibsonian sense of “responding” or “resonating” to opticalinvariants. Of course, this latter Gibsonian claim is a substantive empiricalhypothesis and so does not stand or fall on the basis of logicalconsiderations. Nevertheless, our point is that this claim represents only oneway of explicating the relation between perceptually guided action andanimal-environment mutuality. We disalign ourselves with this explicationbecause we believe it leads to a research strategy in which one attempts tobuild an ecological theory of perception entirely from the side of theenvironment. Such an attempt neglects not only the structural unity (autonomy)of the animal but also the codetermination of animal and environment that wehave gone to such great lengths to stress.[40](#40_3)

## Defining the Enactive Approach 

As we can nowappreciate, to situate cognition as embodied action within the context ofevolution as natural drift provides a view of cognitive capacities asinextricably linked to histories that are lived, muchlike paths that exist only as they are laid down in walking. Consequently,cognition is no longer seen as problem solving on the basis of representations;instead, cognition in its most encompassing sense consists in the enactment orbringing forth of a world by a viable history of structural coupling. 

It should be noted thatsuch histories of coupling are not optimal; they are, rather, simply viable.This difference implies a corresponding difference in what is required of acognitive system in its structural coupling. If this coupling were to beoptimal, the interactions of the system would have to be (more or less)prescribed. For coupling to be viable, however, the perceptually guided actionof the system must simply facilitate the continuing integrity of the system(ontogeny) and/or its lineage (phylogeny). Thus once again we have a logic thatis proscriptive rather than prescriptive: any action undertaken by the systemis permitted as long as it is does not violate the constraint of having tomaintain the integrity of the system and/or its lineage. 

Yet another way to express this idea would be to say that cognition asembodied action is always about or directed toward something that is missing:on the one hand, there is always a next step for the systemin its perceptually guided action; and on the other hand, the actions of thesystem are always directed toward situations thathave yet to become actual. Thus cognition as embodied action both poses theproblems and specifies those paths that must be tread or laid down for theirsolution. 

This formulation alsoprovides us with a way of specifying the aboutness or intentionality ofcognition as embodied action. It should be recalled that, in general,intentionality has two sides: first, intentionality includes how the systemconstrues the world to be (specified in terms of the semantic content ofintentional states); second, intentionality includes how the world satisfies orfails to satisfy this construal (specified in terms of the conditions ofsatisfaction of intentional states).[41](#41_3)We would say that the intentionality of cognition as embodied action consistsprimarily in the directedness of action. Here the two-sidedness ofintentionality corresponds to what the system takes its possibilities for actionto be and to how the resulting situations fulfill or fail to fulfill thesepossibilities.[42](#42_3) 

What does thisreconceptualization of the intentionality of cognition imply in more pragmaticterms for cognitive science? Consider that there are two domains in which wecan describe any cognitive system: on the one hand, we can focus on thestructure of the system by describing it as composed of various subsystems,etc., and on the other hand, we can focus on the behavioral interactions of thesystem by describing it as a unity capable of various forms of coupling. Inswitching back and forth between these two kinds of description, we—that is,cognitive scientists—must determine both how the environment constrains thesystem and how these constraints themselves are specified by the sensorimotorstructure of the system (recall the quotation from Merleau-Ponty in theprevious chapter). In so doing, we are able to explain howregularities—sensorimotor and environmental—emerge from structural coupling.The research task in cognitive science is to make transparent the mechanisms bywhich such coupling actually unfolds and thereby how specific regularitiesarise. Many theoretical elements are already in place (emergent properties innetwork behaviors, natural drift in lineages of reproductive organisms,developmental switches, etc.); many others remain to be specified. 

We are now ready toformulate in precise terms the enactive approach in cognitive science. Let usanswer, then, the same questions that we addressed to cognitivism and to theemergence program. 

Question 1: 

What is cognition? 

Answer: 

Enaction: A history of structural coupling that brings forth a world. 

 

Question 2: 

How does it work? 

Answer: 

Through a network consisting of multiple levels of interconnected,sensorimotor subnetworks. 

 

Question 3: 

How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? 

[Answer: ]()

When it becomes part of an ongoing existing world (as the young ofevery species do) or shapes a new one (as happens in evolutionary history). 

Much that appears inthese answers has hitherto been absent from cognitive science—not just fromcognitivism but from present-day, state-of-the-art connectionism. The mostsignificant innovation is that since representations no longer play a centralrole, the role of the environment as a source of input recedes into thebackground. It now enters in explanations only on those occasions when systemsundergo breakdowns or suffer events that cannot be satisfied by theirstructures. Accordingly, intelligence shifts from being the capacity to solve aproblem to the capacity to enter into a shared world of significance. 

At this point, however,the pragmatic reader might be somewhat impatient: “All this fuss about enactionas opposed to representation is fine, but what realdifference does it make, say, in artificial intelligence and robotics? Ifsomething like the enactive approach begins to affect the way engineers buildcognitive artifacts, then I’ll pay attention.” 

We take this kind ofpragmatic response quite seriously. Indeed, we have stressed from the veryfirst chapter that cognitive science cannot be separated from cognitivetechnology. Thus we do not offer the enactive approach as a refined,European-flavored position that has no hands-on applications in cognitivescience. On the contrary, we claim that without the key notions of the enactiveapproach, cognitive science will be unable both to account for living cognitionand to build truly intelligent, cognitive artifacts. We will now consider howthe enactive approach can affect hands-on research in cognitive science,especially robotics and artificial intelligence. 

## EnactiveCognitive Science 

In general withinenactive cognitive science a process akin to evolution as natural drift takesthe place of task-oriented design. For example, simulations of prolongedhistories of coupling with various evolutionary strategies enable us todiscover trends wherein cognitive performances arise.[43](#43_3)Such a strategy is feasible in all areas of cognitive science—provided that weare willing to relax the constraints of some specific problem-solvingperformance. This willingness does in fact appear to be increasing in recentresearch. (Thus consider the development of so-called classifier systems, whichare designed to confront an undefined environment that must be shaped intosignificance.)[44](#44_3) Our discussion will focus onrecent developments in the field of robotics, that is, the attempt to developmobile and intelligent artifacts, which is increasingly found at the center ofAI research. 

Like connectionism, thefield of robotics has gradually begun to appreciate that much early pioneeringwork in the cybernetic era was—contrary to the received cognitivist history—onthe right track after all. Thus a recent popular book acknowledges theimportance of this early work, especially that of Gray Walter and Ross Ashbywho built machines that could be autonomous and operate in ordinary humanenvironments.[45](#45_3) Let us take a closer look at anexplicitly formulated research strategy that harkens back to this earlier erabut also takes the further step of formulating within robotics research aprogram akin to our enactive orientation. 

The research to which werefer is that of Rodney Brooks in the AI laboratory at MIT.[46](#46_3)On the first page of his paper, “Intelligence withoutRepresentation,” Brooks presents his approach: 

In this paper I … argue for a different approach to creating ArtificialIntelligence: 

·     We must incrementally build up thecapabilities of intelligent systems at each step of the way and thusautomatically ensure that the pieces and their interfaces are valid. 

·     At each step we should buildcomplete intelligent systems that we let loose in the real world with realsensing and real action. Anything less provides a candidate with which we candelude ourselves. 

We have been following this approach and have built a series ofautonomous mobile robots. We have reached an unexpected conclusion (C) and have a rather radical hypothesis (H). 

C: When we examine verysimple level intelligence we find that explicit representations and models ofthe world simply get in the way. It turns out to be better to use the world asits own model. 

H: Representation is thewrong unit of abstraction in building the bulkiest parts of intelligentsystems. 

Representation has been the central issue in Artificial Intelligencework over the last 15 years only because it has provided an interface betweenotherwise isolated modules and conference papers. 

It is interesting tonote that in this paper Brooks also traces the origin of what he describes asthe “deception of Al” to the tendency in AI for abstraction, for factoring outperception and motor skills. As we have argued here, however, and as Brooksargues for his own reasons, such abstraction misses the essence ofintelligence, which resides only in its embodiment. 

Brooks’s goal is tobuild “completely autonomous robots, mobile agents that co-exist in the worldwith humans, and are seen by those humans as intelligent beings in their ownright.”[47](#47_3) His key move in working towardthis goal is not the usual decomposition of a system by functionbut rather a novel decomposition by activity (see [figure 9.2](#fig_002_4)).In his words, 

![9739_009_fig_002.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image051.png)

[Figure 9.2](#fig_002a_4) Behavior-baseddecomposition. From Brooks, Achieving artificial intelligence through buildingrobots. 

[An alternativedecomposition makes no distinction between peripheral systems, such as vision,and central systems. Rather the fundamental slicing up of an intelligent systemis in the orthogonal direction dividing it into activityproducing subsystems. Each activity, or behavior, producing system individuallyconnects sensing to action. We refer to an activity producing system as a layer [see ]()[figures 9.2](#fig_002_4) and [9.3](#fig_003_4)]. An activity is a pattern of interactions with the world. Anothername for our activities might well be skillemphasizing that each activity can at least post facto be rationalized aspursuing some purpose. We have chosen the word activity however because ourlayers must decide when to act for themselves, not be some subroutine to beinvoked at the beck and call of some other layer. … 

![9739_009_fig_003.jpg](file://localhost/Users/awesomejason/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/msoclip1/01/clip_image053.png)

[Figure 9.3](#fig_003a_4) Finite statemachines are wired together into layers of control. Each layer is built on topof existing layers. Lower levels never rely on the existence of higher-levellayers. From Brooks, Intelligence without representation. 

The idea is to first build a very simple complete autonomous system,and test it in the real world. Our favorite exampleof such a system is a Creature, actually a mobile robot, which avoids hittingthings. It senses objects in its immediate vicinity and moves away from them,halting if it senses something in its path. It is still necessary to build thissystem by decomposing it into parts, but there need be no clear distinctionbetween a “perception subsystem,” a “central system” and an “action system.” Infact there may well be two independent channels connecting sensing to action(one for initiating motion, and one for emergency halts), so there is no singleplace where “perception” delivers a representation of the world in thetraditional sense.[48](#c9_note_48) 

It is, of course, of theutmost significance that Brooks insists that there are no representationsinvolved in the layers of his Creatures. Instead, each individual layer simplyspecifies or makes evident those aspects of the Creature’s world that arerelevant. Equally significant is that his Creatures haveno central system. Instead, the layers carry out their activities on their own;the compatibility of the layers gives rise to a sense of purpose only in theeyes of the observers: “Out of the local chaos of their interactions thereemerges, in the eye of an observer, a coherent pattern of behavior.”[49](#49_3) 

The implementation ofthis “decomposition by activity” has yielded so far a succession of four mobilerobots in which layer is superimposed upon layer, thereby making the autonomousbehavior of the Creature more and more interesting (see [figure 9.3](#fig_003_4)). These robots are all Creatures in thesense that on power-up they are viable in any world in which they are letloose. Brooks’s hope is to reach the level of insect intelligence (a truelandmark in Brooks’s view) within two years by building a Creature composed offourteen layers. Thus Brooks’s strategy stands in sharp contrast to theclassical approach, where robots or other AI artifacts are given specificgoals, tasks, or plans. 

The pragmatist bent onhaving immediate results tomorrow might be frustrated with this approach. We,however, are willing to bet with Brooks that in the relatively short term,perhaps a few years, such artifacts will have evolved into generations ofsufficiently intelligent Creatures whose efficacy can begin to be exploited. Webelieve that this fully enactive approach to AI is one of the most promisingavenues of research available today, but it needs to be given a chance byappreciating its possibilities in a context that is not limited to concern withshort-term applications. 

This example of what weare calling enactive AI is distinctively and clearly formulated as such by itsproponents (of course, they do not use our term enactive).As Brooks himself states, his approach is neither connectionism nor productionrules nor hermeneutics. It is motivated by the same good old engineeringconcerns that gave us both cognitivism and connectionism. It is precisely theseengineering concerns that reveal most clearly how the notion of cognition asenaction is being generated by the very logic of research and development inpresent-day cognitive science. The enactive approach, then, is no merephilosophical preference but the result of forces internal to research incognitive science, even in the case of those hard-nosed engineers who desire tobuild truly intelligent and useful machines. 

The replacement oftask-oriented design by cognitive modeling that is closer to evolution asnatural drift also has implications for the relations between the emergence andenactive approaches. Here the issue turns on how we construe what a distributednetwork can do. If we emphasize how historical processes lead to emergentregularities without fixed and final constraints, then we recover the moreopen-ended biological condition. On the other hand, if we emphasize how a givennetwork acquires a very specific capacity in a very definite domain (forexample, NetTalk), then representations return, and we have the more typicaluse of connectionist models. 

Consider as an examplePaul Smolensky’s harmony theory. Smolensky’s paradigm of subsymboliccomputation is generally compatible with the concerns of the enactive program.The remaining point of difference consists in Smolensky’s evaluation of hismodels by reference to an unviolated level of environmental reality. Thus onthe one hand, exogenous features in the task domain correspond to pregivenfeatures of the world, and on the other hand, endogenous activity in thenetwork acquires through experience an abstract meaning that optimally encodesenvironmental regularity. The goal is to find endogenous activity thatcorresponds to an optimality characterization of the surroundings. The enactiveprogram, on the other hand, would require that we eschew any form of optimalfitness by taking this kind of cognitive system into a situation whereendogenous and exogenous features are mutually definitory over a prolongedhistory that requires only a viable coupling. 

The road we take, then,depends strongly on the degree of interest we have in staying close tobiological reality, at the expense, perhaps, of short-term engineeringapplications. It is, of course, always possible to define a fixed domain withinwhich a connectionist system can function, but this approach obscures thedeeper issues about the biological embodiment of cognition that are so centralto the enactive program. Thus just as connectionism grew out of cognitivisminspired by closer contact with the brain, theenactive program takes a further step in the same direction to encompass thetemporality of cognition as lived history, whether seen at the level of theindividual (ontogeny), the species (evolution), or social patterns (culture). 

## InConclusion 

This enactive program,which remains removed from the predominantly objectivist/subjectivist mood ofmost contemporary science, would have been mere heterodoxy only a few yearsago. Today, however, the inner logic of research in cognitive psychology,linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, evolutionary theory, andimmunology seems to incorporate more and more working elements of an enactiveorientation. We have developed in some detail the situation in the field ofrobotics, not because we think such engineering products are the final resultof this scientific orientation but rather to make it clear that in any concreteresearch program even the most pragmatic levels are touched. This is not theplace to develop other areas that illustrate the same ideas at work. The debateis now heatedly on its way, and so researchers will no doubt subscribe tovarious intermediate positions and draw somewhat different epistemologicalconclusions. Nevertheless, these debates indicate that an enactive program isno longer the property of a few eccentric researchers but rather an alive and diverseresearch program that continues to grow. 

We have now reached theend of our presentation of the enactive approach in cognitive science. We haveseen not only that cognition is embodied action, and so inextricably tied tohistories that are lived, but also that these lived histories are the result ofevolution as natural drift. Thus our human embodiment and the world that isenacted by our history of coupling reflect only one of many possibleevolutionary pathways. We are always constrained by the path we have laid down,but there is no ultimate ground to prescribe the steps that we take. It isprecisely this lack of an ultimate ground that we have evoked at various pointsin this book by writing of groundlessness. This groundlessness of laying down apath is the philosophical issue that remains to be addressed.

[V ]()Worlds without Ground 

# [10 ]()The Middle Way 

## Evocations of Groundlessness 

Our journey has nowbrought us to the point where we can appreciate that what we took to be solidground is really more like shifting sand beneath our feet. We began with ourcommon sense as cognitive scientists and found that our cognition emerges from thebackground of a world that extends beyond us but that cannot be found apartfrom our embodiment. When we shifted our attention away from this fundamentalcircularity to follow the movement of cognition alone, we found that we coulddiscern no subjective ground, no permanent and abiding ego-self. When we triedto find the objective ground that we thought must still be present, we found aworld enacted by our history of structural coupling. Finally, we saw that thesevarious forms of groundlessness are really one: organism and environment enfoldinto each other and unfold from one another in the fundamental circularity thatis life itself. 

Our discussion ofenactive cognition points directly toward the heart of our concerns in thischapter and the next. The worlds enacted by various histories of structuralcoupling are amenable to detailed scientific investigation, yet have no fixed,permanent substrate or foundation and so are ultimately groundless. We must nowturn to face directly this groundlessness of which we have had multipleevocations. If our world is groundless, how are we to understand our day-to-dayexperience within it? Our experience feels given, unshakable, and unchangeable.How could we not ex­perience the world as independent and well grounded? Whatelse could experience of the world mean? 

Western science andphilosophy have brought us to the point where we are faced with, in the wordsof the philosopher Hilary Putnam, “the impossibility of imagining what credible‘foundations’ might look like,”[1](#1_21) but they have not provided any wayfor us to develop direct and personal insight into the groundlessness of ourown experience. Philosophers may think that this task is unnecessary, but thisis largely because Western philosophy has been more concerned with the rationalunderstanding of life and mind than with the relevance of a pragmatic methodfor transforming human experience. 

Indeed, it is largely agiven in contemporary philosophical debate that whether the world ismind-dependent or mind-independent makes little difference, if any, to oureveryday experience. To think otherwise would be to deny not only “metaphysicalrealism” but empirical, everyday commonsense realism, which is absurd. But thiscurrent philosophical assumption confuses two very different senses that theterm empirical realism can have. On the one hand, itmight mean that our world will continue to be the familiar one of objects andevents with various qualities, even if we discover that this world is notpregiven and well grounded. On the other hand, it might mean that we willalways experience this familiar world as if it were ultimately grounded, thatwe are “condemned” to experience the world as if it had a ground, even thoughwe know philosophically and scientifically that it does not. This lattersupposition is not innocent, for it imposes an a priori limitation on thepossibilities for human development and transformation. It is important to seethat we can contest this supposition without calling into question the firstsense in which things can be said to be real and independent. 

The reason this point is important is that our historical situationrequires not only that we give up philosophical foundationalism but that welearn to live in a world without foundations. Science alone—that is, sciencewithout any bridge to everyday human experience—is incapable of this task. AsHilary Putnam incisively remarks in a recent work, “Science is wonderful atdestroying metaphysical answers, but incapable of providing substitute ones.Science takes away foundations without providing a replacement. Whether we wantto be there or not, science has put us in the position of having to livewithout foundations. It was shocking when Nietzsche said this, but today it iscommonplace; our historical position—and no end to itis in sight—is that of having to philosophize without ‘foundations’.”[2](#2_21) 

Although it is true thatour historical situation is unique, we should not draw the conclusion that westand alone in the attempt to learn to live without foundations. To interpretour situation in this way would immediately prevent us from recognizing thatother traditions have, in their own ways, addressed this very issue of the lackof foundations. In fact, the problematic of groundlessness is the focal pointof the Madhyamaka tradition. With one or two exceptions, Western philosophershave yet to draw on the resources of this tradition. Indeed, one often gets theimpression that Western philosophers are not simply unfamiliar with Madhyamakabut that they suppose a priori that our situation is so unique that no otherphilosophical tradition could be relevant. Richard Rorty, for example, afterthoroughly criticizing the project of foundationalism in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, offers in its place aconception of “edifying philosophy” whose guiding ideal is “continuing theconversation of the West.”[3](#3_20) Rorty does not even pause toconsider the possibility of there being other traditions of philosophicalreflection that might have addressed his very concerns. In fact, it is one suchimportant tradition, the Madhyamaka, which has served as the basis for ourthought in this book.[4](#4_21) 

## Nagarjunaand the Madhyamaka Tradition 

Hitherto we have spokenof the Buddhist tradition of mindfulness/awareness as though it were all oneunified tradition. And in fact, the teachings of no-self—the five aggregates,some form of mental factor analysis, and karma and the wheel of conditionedorigination—are common to all of the major Buddhist traditions. At this point,however, we come to a split. The teaching of emptiness (sunyata), which we areabout to explore, according to the Buddhist tradition itself as well as toscholarship, did not become apparent until approximately 500 years after theBuddha’s death, at which time the Prajnaparamita andother texts that expound this doctrine began to appear. During those 500 years,the Abhidharma tradition had become elaborated into eighteen different schoolsthat debated each other about various subtle points and debated the manynon-Buddhist schools within Hinduism and Jainism. Those who adopted the newerteachings called themselves the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) and designated thosewho continued to adhere to the earlier teachings the Lesser Vehicle(Hinayana)—an epithet to this day widely loathed by non-Mahayanists. One of theeighteen original schools, the Theravada (the speech of the elders) hassurvived with great vigor in the modern world; it is the undisputed form ofBuddhism in the countries of Southeast Asia—Burma, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos,and Thailand. Theravada Buddhism does not teach sunyata. Sunyata is, however,the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism (the form that spread to China, Korea, andJapan) and of the Vajrayana, the Buddhism of Tibet. 

In approximately thefirst half of the second century CE, the Prajnaparamita teachings were put intoa form of philosophical argument by Nagarjuna (according to some Mahayanaschools and many, but not all, Western scholars).[5](#5_21)Nagarjuna’s stature in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism is enormous. His methodwas to work solely by means of refutation of the positions and assertions ofothers. His followers soon split into those whocontinued this method, which is very demanding for the listener as well as forthe speaker (the Prasangikas) and those who made positive arguments aboutemptiness (Svatantrikas). 

The Madhyamakatradition, although it delighted in debate and logical argument, is not to betaken as abstract philosophy in the modern sense. For one thing, the debate wasconsidered so meaningful in the social context of the courts and universitiesof early India that the losing side in a debate was expected to convert. Moreimportant, the philosophy was never to be divorced from meditation practice orfrom the daily activities of life. The point was to realize egolessness inone’s own experience and manifest it in action to others. Texts discussing thephilosophy included meditation manuals for how to contemplate, meditate, andact on the topic. 

In exposition ofNagarjuna in the present day, there is a split between Buddhist practitioners(including traditionally trained practitioner scholars) and Western academicscholars. Practitioners say that Western scholars are making up issues,interpretations, and confusions that have nothing to do with the texts or withBuddhism. Western scholars feel that the opinions (and teachings) of“believers” are not an appropriate source for textual exegesis. Since in thisbook we wish to bring into contact the living tradition ofmindfulness/awareness meditation with the living tradition of phenomenology andof cognitive science, for our exposition of the Madhyamaka we will draw fromthe practitioner as well as from the scholarly side of this interestingsociological detente. 

Sunyata literally means “emptiness” (sometimes misleadingly translated as “thevoid” or “voidness”). In the Tibetan tradition, it is said that sunyata may beexpounded from three perspectives—sunyata with respect to codependent arising,sunyata with respect to compassion, and sunyata with respect to naturalness. Itis the first of these, sunyata with respect to codependent arising, that mostnaturally fits with the logic we have been exploring in the discovery ofgroundlessness and its relationship to cognitive science and the concept ofenaction. 

Nagarjuna’s most wellknown work is the Stanzas of the Middle Way (Mulamadhyamakakarikas). From the perspective that we willnow examine, it carries through the logic of codependent arising to its logicalconclusion. 

In the Abhidharmaanalysis of consciousness, each moment of experience takes the form of aparticular consciousness that has a particular object to which it is tied byparticular relations. For example, a moment of seeing consciousness is composedof a seer (the subject) who sees (the relation) a sight (the object); in amoment of anger consciousness, the one who is angry (the subject) experiences(the relation) anger (the object). (This is what we have calledprotointentionality.) The force of the analysis was to show that there was notruly existing subject (a self) continuing unchangingly through a series ofmoments. But what of the objects of consciousness? And what of the relations?The Abhidharma schools had assumed that there were material properties thatwere taken as objects by five of the senses—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting,and touching—and that there were thoughts that were taken as an object by themind consciousness. Such an analysis is still partially subjectivist/objectivistbecause (1) many schools, such as the basic element analysis discussed inchapters 4 and 6, took moments of consciousness as ultimate realities, and (2)the external world had been left in a relatively unproblematic, objectivist,independent state. 

The Mahayana traditiontalks about not just one but two senses of ego-self: ego of self and ego ofphenomena (dharmas). Ego of self is the habitual grasping after a self that wehave been discussing. Mahayanists claim that the earlier traditions attacked thissense of self but did not challenge the reliance on an independently existingworld or the mind’s (momentary) relations to that world. Nagarjuna attacks theindependent existence of all three terms—the subject, the relation, and theobject. What follows will be a (synthetically constructed) example of the kindof argument that Nagarjuna makes.[6](#6_20)

What is it that we mean when we say that the one who sees existsindependently or when we say that that which is seen exists independently?Surely we mean that the one who sees exists even when she is not seeing thesight; she exists prior to and/or after seeing the sight. And likewise we meanthat the sight exists prior to and/or after it is seen by the seer. That is, ifI am the seer of a sight and I truly exist, it means that I can walk away andnot see that sight—I can go hear something or think something instead. And ifthe sight truly exists, it should be able to stay there even when I am notseeing it—for example, it could have someone else see it at a future moment. 

Upon closer examination,however, Nagarjuna points out that this makes little sense. How can we talkabout the seer of a sight who is not seeing its sight? Conversely how can wespeak of a sight that is not being seen by its seer? Nor does it make any senseto say that there is an independently existing seeing going on somewherewithout any seer and without any sight being seen. The very position of a seer,the very idea of a seer, cannot be separated from the sights it sees. And viceversa, how can the sight that is being seen be separated from the seer thatsees it? 

We might try a negativetack and reply that all this is true and that the seer does not exist prior tothe sight and the seeing of it. But then how can a nonexistent seer give riseto an existing seeing and an existing sight? Or if we try to argue the otherway round and say that the sight didn’t exist until the seer saw it, the replyis, How can a nonexistent sight be seen by a seer? 

Let us try the argumentthat the seer and the sight arise simultaneously. In that case, they are eitherone and the same thing, or they are different things. If they are one and thesame thing, then this cannot be a case of seeing, since seeing requires thatthere be one who sees, a sight, and the seeing of the sight. We do not say thatthe eye sees itself. Then they must be two separate, independent things. But inthat case, if they are truly independent things, each existing in its own rightindependently of the relations in which it happens to figure, then there couldbe many relations beside seeing between them. But it makes no sense to say thata seer hears a sight; only a hearer can hear a sound. 

We might give in andagree that there is no truly existent independent seer, sight, or seeing butclaim that all three put together form a truly existent moment of consciousnessthat is the ultimate reality. But if you add one nonexistent thing to anothernonexistent thing, how can you say that that makes a truly existent thing?Indeed, how can you say that a moment of time is a truly existent thing when tobe truly existent, it would have to exist independently of other moments in thepast and future? Furthermore, since one moment is but an aspect of time itself,that moment would have to exist independently of time itself (this is anargument about the codependence of things and their attributes); and timeitself would have to exist independently of that one moment. 

At this point, we mightbe seized with the terrible feeling that indeed these things do not exist. Butsurely it makes even less sense to assert that a nonexistent seer either seesor does not see a nonexistent sight at a nonexistent moment than to make theseclaims about an existent seer. (That this argument has actual psychologicalforce is illustrated by an Israeli joke: Man 1 says, “Things are getting worseand worse; better never to have existed at all.” Man 2 says, “How true. But whoshould be so lucky?—one in ten thousand!”) Nagarjuna’s point is not to say thatthings are nonexistent in an absolute way any more than to say that they areexistent. Things are codependently originated; they are completely groundless. 

Nagarjuna’s argumentsfor complete codependence (or more properly his arguments against any otherconceivable view than codependence) are applied to three main classes oftopics: subjects and their objects, things and their attributes, and causes andtheir effects.[7](#7_19) By these means, he disposes of theidea of noncodependent existence for virtually everything—subject and objectfor each of the senses; material objects; the primal elements (earth, water,fire, air, and space); passion, aggression, and ignorance; space, time, andmotion; the agent, his doing, and what he does; conditions and outcomes; theself as perceiver, doer, or anything else; suffering; the causes of suffering,cessation of suffering, and the path to cessation(known as the Four Noble Truths); the Buddha; and nirvana. Nagarjuna finallyconcludes, “Nothing is found that is not dependently arisen. For that reason,nothing is found that is not empty.”[8](#8_19)

It is important toremember the context within which these arguments are employed. Nagarjuna’sarguments fasten on psychologically real habits of mind and demonstrate theirgroundlessness within the context of mindfulness/awareness meditation andAbhidharma psychology. A modern philosopher might believe himself able to findfaults with Nagarjuna’s logic. Even if this were the case, however, it wouldnot overturn the epistemological and psychological force of Nagarjuna’sargumentation within the context of his concerns. In fact, Nagarjuna’sarguments can be summarized in a way that makes this point apparent: 

1.   If subjects and their objects,things and their attributes, and causes and their effects exist independentlyas we habitually take them to, or exist intrinsically and absolutely as basicelement analysis holds, then they must not depend on any kind of condition orrelation. This point basically amounts to a philosophical insistence on themeanings of independent, intrinsic, and absolute. By definition, something is independent,intrinsic, or absolute only if it does not depend on anything else; it musthave an identity that transcends its relations. 

2.  Nothing in our experience can befound that satisfies this criterion of independence or ultimacy. The earlierAbhidharma tradition had expressed this insight as dependent coarising: nothingcan be found apart from its conditions of arising, formation, and decay. In ourmodern context this point is rather obvious when considering the causes andconditions of the material world and is expressed in our scientific tradition.Nagarjuna took the understanding of codependence considerably further. Causesand their effects, things and their attributes, and the very mind of theinquiring subject and the objects of mind are each equallycodependent on the other. Nagarjuna’s logic addresses itself penetratingly tothe mind of the inquiring subject (recall our fundamental circularity), to theways in which what are actually codependent factors are taken by that subjectto be the ultimate founding blocks of a supposed objective and a supposedsubjective reality. 

3.  Therefore, nothing can be foundthat has an ultimate or independent existence. Or to use Buddhist language,everything is “empty” of an independent existence, for it is codependentlyoriginated. 

We now have a contextfor understanding emptiness with respect to codependent origination: all thingsare empty of any independent intrinsic nature. This may sound like an abstractstatement, but it has far-ranging implications for experience. 

We explained in chapter4 how the categories of the Abhidharma were both descriptions and contemplativedirectives for the way the mind is actually experienced when one is mindful. Itis important to realize that Nagarjuna is not rejecting the Abhidharma, as heis sometimes interpreted as doing in Western scholarship.[9](#9_21)His entire analysis is based on the categories of the Abhidharma: what sensewould arguments such as that of the seer, the sight, and the seeing have exceptin that context? (If the reader thinks that Nagarjuna’s argument is alinguistic one, that is because he has not seen the force of the Abhidharma.)It is a very precise argument, not just a general handwaving that everything isdependent on everything. Nagarjuna is extending the Abhidharma, but thatextension makes an incisive difference to experience. 

Why should it make anydifference at all to experience? One might say, So what if the world and theself change moment to moment—whoever thought that they were permanent? And sowhat if they are mutually dependent on each other—whoever thought they wereisolated? The answer (as we have seen throughout the book) is that as onebecomes mindful of one’s own experience, one realizes the power of the urge tograsp after foundations—to grasp the sense of foundation of a real, separateself, the sense of foundation of a real, separate world, and the sense offoundation of an actual relation between self and world. 

It is said that emptiness is a natural discovery that one would make byoneself with sufficient mindfulness/awareness—natural but shocking. Previouslywe have been talking about examining the mind with meditation. There may nothave been a self, but there was still a mind to examine itself, even if amomentary one. But now we discover that we have no mind; after all, a mind mustbe something that is separate from and knows the world. We also don’t have aworld. There is neither an objective nor subjective pole. Nor is there anyknowing because there is nothing hidden. Knowing sunyata (more accuratelyknowing the world as sunyata) is surely not an intentional act. Rather (to usetraditional imagery), it is like a reflection in a mirror—pure, brilliant, butwith no additional reality apart from itself. As mind/world keeps happening inits interdependent continuity, there is nothing extra on the side of mind or onthe side of world to know or be known further. Whatever experience happens isopen (Buddhist teachers use the word exposed),perfectly revealed just as it is. 

We can now see whyMadhyamaka is called the middle way. It avoids the extreme of eitherobjectivism or subjectivism, of absolutism or nihilism. As is said by theTibetan commentators, “Through ascertaining the reason—that all phenomena aredependent arisings—the extreme of annihilation (nihilism) is avoided, andrealization of dependent-arising of causes and effects is gained. Throughascertaining the thesis—that all phenomena do not inherently exist—the extremeof permanence (absolutism) is avoided, and realization of the emptiness of allphenomena is gained.”[10](#10_20) 

But what does all thismean for the everyday world? I still have a name, a job, memories, and plans.The sun still rises in the morning, and scientists still work to explain that.What of all this? 

## TheTwo Truths 

The Abhidharma analysisof the mind into basic elements and mental factors already contained within itthe distinction between two kinds of truth: ultimate truth, which consisted ofthe basic elements of existence into which experience could be analyzed, andrelative or conventional truth, which was our ordinary, compounded (out of basicelements) experience. Nagarjuna invoked this distinction, gave it new meaning,and insisted on its importance. 

The teaching of the doctrine by the Buddha is based upon two truths:the truth of worldly convention (samvrti) and the ultimate, supreme truth (paramartha).

Those who do not discern the distinction between these two truths, donot understand the profound nature of the Buddha’s teaching (XXIV: 8–9). 

Relative truth (samvrti,which literally means covered or concealed) is the phenomenal world just as itappears—with chairs, people, species, and the coherence of those through time.Ultimate truth (paramartha) is the emptiness of that very same phenomenalworld. The Tibetan term for relative truth, kundzop,captures the relation between the two imagistically; kundzopmeans all dressed up, outfitted, or costumed—that is, relative truth is sunyata(absolute truth) costumed in the brilliant colors of the phenomenal world. 

By now it should beobvious that the distinction between the two truths, like the analysis of theAbhidharma, was not intended as a metaphysical theory of truth. It is adescription of the experience of the practitioner who experiences his mind, itsobjects, and their relation as codependently originated and thus as empty ofany actual, independent, or abiding existence. Like the Abhidharma categories,the description also functions as a recommendation and contemplative aid. Thiscan be seen very clearly in the discourse of Buddhist communities. For example,many of the forms that Westerners take as poetry orirrationality in Zen are actually contemplative exercises directing the mindtoward codependent emptiness. 

The term for relativetruth, samvrti, is also often translated as“convention” (within Buddhism as well as by academic scholars), which givesrise to much interpretative confusion. It is important to understand in whatsense convention is meant. “Relative” or “conventional” should not be taken ina superficial sense. Convention does not mean subjective, arbitrary, orunlawful. And relative does not mean culturally relative. The relativephenomenal world was always taken to operate by very clear laws regardless ofthe conventions of any individual or society, such as the laws of karmic causeand effect. 

Furthermore, it is veryimportant to understand that the use of convention here is not an invitation todecenter the self and/or world into language as is so popular at present in thehumanities. As the founder of the Gelugpa lineage in Tibetan Buddhism puts it,“… since nominally designated things are artificial, that is, established asexistent in conventional terms, there is no referent to which names areattached which (itself) is not established as merely conventionally existent.And since that is not to say that in general there is no phenomenal basis forusing names, the statement of the existence of that (conventional referent) andthe statement that (all things) are mere nominal designations are notcontradictory.”[11](#11_18) Thus in Buddhism one canperfectly well make distinctions in the relative world between true statementsand false ones, and it is recommended that one make true ones. 

The sense in which thethings designated, as well as the designations, are only conventional may beexplained by an example: when I call someone John, Ihave the deep assumption that there is some abiding independent thing that I amdesignating, but Madhyamaka analysis shows there to be no such truly existingthing. John, however, continues to act just the way a perfectly good designatumis supposed to, so in relative or conventional truth he is indeed John. Thisclaim may remind the reader of our discussion of color. Although the experienceof color can be shown to have no absolute ground either in the physical worldor the visual observer, color is nonetheless a perfectly commensurabledesignable. Thus such scientific analysis can perfectly well be joined by thefar more radical presentation of groundlessness in the Madhyamaka. 

Because this relative,conventional, codependently originated world is lawful, science ispossible—just as possible as daily life. In fact, perfectly functionalpragmatic science and engineering are possible even when they are based ontheories that make unjustifiable metaphysical assumptions—just as daily lifecontinues coherently even when one believes in the actual reality of oneself.We offer the vision of enactive cognitive science and of evolution as naturaldrift neither as a claim that this is the only way science can be done nor as aclaim that this is the very same thing as Madhyamaka. Concepts such asembodiment or structural coupling are concepts and assuch are always historical. They do not convey that at this verymoment—personally—one has no independently existing mind and no independentlyexisting world. 

This is a cruciallyimportant point. There is a powerful reason why some Madhyamaka schools onlyrefute the arguments of others and refuse to make assertions. Any conceptualposition can become a ground (a resting point, a nest), which vitiates theforce of the Madhyamaka. In particular, the view of cognition as embodiedaction (enaction), although it stresses the interdependence of mind and world,tends to treat the relationship between those (the interaction, the action, theenaction) as though it had some form of independent actual existence. As one’smind grasps the concept of enaction as something real and solid, itautomatically generates a sense of the other two terms of the argument, thesubject and object of the embodied action. (As we shall discuss, this is whypragmatism is also not the same thing as the middle way of Madhyamaka.) Wewould be doing a great disservice to everyone concerned—mindfulness/awarenesspractitioners, scientists, scholars, and any other interested persons—were weto lead anyone to believe that making assertions about enactive cognitivescience was the same thing as allowing one’s mind to be experientiallyprocessed by the Madhyamaka dialectic, particularlywhen this is combined with mindfulness/awareness training. But just as theMadhyamaka dialectic, a provisional and conventional activity of the relativeworld, points beyond itself, so we might hope that our concept of enactioncould, at least for some cognitive scientists and perhaps even for the moregeneral milieu of scientific thought, point beyond itself to a truerunderstanding of groundlessness. 

## Groundlessnessin Contemporary Thought 

We began this chapter byevoking the sense of loss of foundations in contemporary science andphilosophy. In particular, we cited one important trend in contemporaryAnglo-American thought based on a revival of pragmatist philosophy.[12](#12_16) In Europe—particularly France,Germany, and Italy—an analogous critique of foundations has been pursued,largely as a result of the continuing influence of Nietzsche and Heidegger—atrend that includes both poststructuralism[13](#13_17) and postmodern thought.[14](#14_17) The Italian philosopher GianniVattimo describes this trend as “weak thought” (pensierodebole)—that is, a kind of thought that wouldgive up the modernist quest for foundations, yet without criticizing this questin the name of another, truer foundation.[15](#15_16) Vattimo defends the positivepossibilities of this trend in the introduction to a recent work: 

The ideas of Nietzsche and Heidegger, more than any others, offer usthe chance to pass from a purely critical and negative description of thepost-modern condition … to an approach that treats it as a positive possibilityand opportunity. Nietzsche mentions all of this—although not altogetherclearly—in his theory of a possibly active, or positive, nihilism. Heideggeralludes to the same thing with his idea of a Verwindungof metaphysics which is not a critical overcoming in the ‘modern’ sense of theterm. … In both Nietzsche and Heidegger, what I have elsewhere called the“weakening” of Being allows thought to situate itself in a constructive mannerwithin the post-modern condition. For only if we take seriously the outcome ofthe “destruction of ontology” undertaken by Heidegger, and before him byNietzsche, is it possible to gain access to the positive opportunities for thevery essence of man that are found in post-modern conditions of existence. Itwill not be possible for thought to live positively in that trulypost-metaphysical era as long as man and Being are conceived of—metaphysically,Platonically, etc.—in terms of stable structures. Such conceptions requirethought and existence to “ground” themselves, or in other words to stabilizethemselves (with logic or with ethics), in the domain of non-becoming and arereflected in a whole-scale mythization of strong structures in every field ofexperience. This is not to say that everything in such an era will be acceptedas equally beneficial for humanity; but the capacity to choose and discriminatebetween the possibilities that the post-modern condition offers us can bedeveloped only on the basis of an analysis of post-modernity that captures itsown innate characteristics, and that recognizes post-modernity as a field ofpossibility and not simply as a hellish negation of all that is human.[16](#16_17) 

It is thus clear thatour contemporary world has become highly sensitized to the issue ofgroundlessness for a number of reasons in history, politics, art, science, andphilosophical reflection. We certainly cannot delve into these developmentshere. We do find remarkable, however, the extent to which the Westerntradition, based on the reasoning of philosophy and scientific practices, andthe Buddhist tradition and thought, based on experiencing the world withmindfulness/awareness, have converged. Nevertheless this convergence might be atrompe l’oeil; indeed many meditation practitioners would argue that the veryappearance of similarity of the two traditions is spurious. In this regard, wewish to point out what we believe are three major differences between thecontemporary sense of groundlessness and that of Madhyamaka. Then in the nextand final chapter we will consider the ethical dimensions of groundlessness. 

### The Lack of an Entre-deux 

In the first place,contemporary Western views have been unable to articulate together the loss offoundations for the self and for the world. There is no methodological basisfor a middle way between objectivism and subjectivism (both forms ofabsolutism). In cognitive science and in experimental psychology, thefragmentation of the self occurs because the field is trying to bescientifically objective. Precisely because the self is taken as an object,like any other external object in the world, as an object of scientificscrutiny—precisely for that reason—it disappears from view. That is, the veryfoundation for challenging the subjective leaves intact the objective as afoundation. In an exactly analogous fashion, challenges to the objective statusof the world depend upon leaving the subjective unproblematical. To espousethat an organism’s (or scientist’s) perception is never entirely objectivebecause it is always influenced by past experience and goals—the scientist’stop-down processes—is precisely the result of taking an independent subject asgiven and then discovering and arguing from the subjective nature of his representations.

Nowhere is slight ofhand between the inner and the outer more evident than in the work of DavidHume, whose classic passage on his inability to observe a self we have alreadyquoted. Hume also noted that there was a contradiction between his idea thatouter bodies (the outer world) have a “continued and distinct existence” andhis sense impressions of bodies that were discontinuous. In his contemplationof this issue, he suggests that the idea of a continuous external world (likethat of a continuous self) is a psychological construction: “There being herean opposition betwixt the notion of the identity of resembling perceptions, andthe interruption of their appearance, the mind must be uneasy in thatsituation, and will naturally seek relief from the uneasiness. … In order tofree ourselves from this difficulty, we disguise, as much as possible, theinterruption, or rather remove it entirely, by supposing that these interruptedperceptions are connected by a real existence, of which we are insensible.”[17](#17_15) The interesting point for ourpresent purposes is that there is no evidence that Hume ever thought to puttogether his empiricist doubts about the self and about the world. He had all theintellectual materials needed for an entre-deux, but with neither anintellectual tradition to suggest it nor an experiential method to discover it,he never considered the possibility. 

Our final example is aparticularly telling one as it comes from the heart of cognitive scienceitself. What does a modern cognitivist do if his experience does lead him toapproach the entre-deux—the fact that lived experience of the world is actuallybetween what we think of as the world and what we think of as the mind? Hetakes flight into theory—the current scientific milieu gives him no otheroption. We are thinking of Jackendoff, a sensitive phenomenologist who seemedled to construct the pièce de résistance of his book, the intermediate-leveltheory of consciousness, out of his perception of the betweenness of thephenomenological mind: 

On the one hand, intuition suggests that awareness reveals what isgoing on in the mind, including thought. On the other hand, intuition suggeststhat awareness reveals what is going on out in the world, that is, the resultof sensation or perception. According to the Intermediate-Level Theory, itreveals neither. Rather, awareness reflects a curious amalgam of the effects onthe mind of both thought and the real world, while leaving totally opaque themeans by which these effects come about. It is only bydeveloping a formal theory of levels of representation that we couldhave come to suspect the existence of a part of the computational mind that hasthese characteristics [our emphasis].[18](#18_15)

### Interpretationism

One of the mostseductive forms of subjectivism in contemporary thought is the use made of theconcepts of interpretation, whether by pragmatists or hermeneuticists. To itscredit, interpretationism provides a penetrating critique of objectivism thatis worth pursuing in some detail. To be objective, the interpretationist pointsout, one would have to have some set of mind-independent objects to bedesignated by language or known by science. But can we find any such objects?Let us look at an extended example from the philosopher Nelson Goodman. 

A point in space seemsto be perfectly objective. But how are we to define the points of our everydayworld? Points can be taken either as primitive elements, as intersecting lines,as certain triples of intersecting planes, or as certain classes of nestingvolumes. These definitions are equally adequate, and yet they are incompatible:what a point is will vary with each form of description. For example, only inthe first “version,” to use Goodman’s term, will a point be a primitiveelement. The objectivist, however, demands, “What are points really?” Goodman’sresponse to this demand is worth quoting at length: 

If the composition of points out of lines or of lines out of points isconventional rather than factual, points and lines themselves are no less so. …If we say that our sample space is a combination of points, or of lines, or ofregions, or a combination of combinations of points, or lines, or regions, or acombination of all these together, or is a single lump, then since none isidentical with any of the rest, we are giving one among countless alternativeconflicting descriptions of what the space is. And so we may regard thedisagreements as not about the facts but as due to differences in theconventions—adopted in organizing or describing the space. What, then, is theneutral fact or thing described in these different terms? Neither the space (a) as an undivided whole nor (b)as a combination of everything involved in the several accounts; for (a) and (b) are but two among thevarious ways of organizing it. But what is it that isso organized? When we strip off as layers of convention all differences amongways of describing it, what is left? The onion ispeeled down to its empty core.[19](#19_15) 

The appearance of theword empty here is of interest. Contemporaryphilosophy is replete with such examples of how things are empty of anyintrinsic identity because they depend on forms of designation. Hilary Putnamhas even devised a theorem in formal semantics to show that there can be nounique mapping between words and the world: even if we know the conditionsunder which sentences are true, we cannot fix the way their terms refer.[20](#20_15) Putnam concludes that we cannotunderstand meaning if we hold on to the idea that there is some privileged setof mind-independent objects to which language refers. Instead, he writes,“‘Objects’ do not exist independently of conceptual schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one oranother scheme of description. Since the objects andthe signs are alike internal to the scheme ofdescription, it is possible to say what matches what.”[21](#c10_note_21) 

Interestingly, Putnamargues not only that we cannot understand meaning if we suppose language refersto mind-independent objects; he also argues against the very notion ofproperties that exist intrinsically (i.e., nondependently), a notion that liesat the basis of objectivism: “The problem with the ‘Objectivist’ picture of theworld … [t]he deep systemic root of the disease, I want to suggest, lies in thenotion of an ‘intrinsic’ property, a property something has ‘in itself,’ apartfrom any contribution made by language or the mind.”[22](#22_15) Putnam argues that this classicalidea, combined with contemporary scientific realism, leads to the completedevaluation of experience, for virtually all of the features of our life-worldbecome mere “projections” of the mind. The irony of this stance—which we shouldnonetheless expect from our discussion of the Cartesian anxiety—is that itbecomes indistinguishable from idealism, for it makes the lived world a resultof subjective representation. 

Yet despite this thorough critique of objectivism, the argument isnever turned the other way round. Mind-independent objects are challenged, butobject-independent minds never are. (It is actually more obvious andpsychologically easier to attack the independence of objects than of minds.)The interpretationists—pragmatist or otherwise—also do not challenge thegroundedness of the concepts and interpretations themselves; rather, they takethese as the ground on which they stand. This is far from an entre-deux and farfrom Madhyamaka. 

### Transformative Potential 

When contemporarytraditions of thought discover groundlessness, it is viewed as negative, abreakdown of an ideal for doing science, for establishing philosophical truthwith reason, or for living a meaningful life. Enactive cognitive science and,in a certain sense, contemporary Western pragmatism require that we confrontthe lack of ultimate foundations. Both, while challenging theoreticalfoundations, wish to affirm the everyday lived world. Enactive cognitivescience and pragmatism, however, are both theoretical; neither offers insightinto how we are to live in a world without foundations. In the Madhyamakatradition, on the other hand, as in all Buddhism, the intimation of egolessnessis a great blessing; it opens up the lived world as path, as the locus forrealization. Thus Nagarjuna writes, “Ultimate truth cannot be taught apart fromeveryday practices. Without understanding the ultimate truth, freedom (nirvana)is not attained” (XXIV: 10). On the Buddhist path, one needs to be embodied toattain realization. Mindfulness, awareness, and emptiness are not abstractions;there has to be something to be mindful of, aware of, and to realize theemptiness of (and as we will see in chapter 11, to realize the intrinsicgoodness of and to be compassionate for). One’s very habitual patterns of grasping,anxiety, and frustration are the contents of mindfulness and awareness. Therecognition that those are empty of any actual existence manifests itselfexperientially as an ever-growing openness and lack of fixation. Anopen-hearted sense of compassionate interest in others can replace the constantanxiety and irritation of egoistic concern. 

In early Buddhism,freedom was equated with escape from samsara (the everyday lived world offixation, habit, and suffering) to the unconditional realm of nirvana. With theteaching of emptiness in the Mahayana, a radical change occurred. Nagarjunaputs it, 

There is no distinction at all between the everyday world (samsara) andfreedom (nirvana). There is no distinction at all between freedom and theeveryday world. 

The range of the everyday world is the range of freedom. Between themnot even the most subtle difference can be found. (XXV: 19, 20) 

Freedom is not the sameas living in the everyday world conditioned by ignorance and confusion; it isliving and acting in the everyday world with realization. Freedom does not meanescape from the world; it means transformation of our entire way of being, ourmode of embodiment, within the lived world itself. 

This stance is not aneasy one for anyone to understand—in cultures where Buddhism flourishes letalone in the modern world. We think that the denial of an ultimate ground istantamount to the denial of there being any ultimate truth or goodness aboutour world and experience. The reason that we almost automatically draw thisconclusion is that we have not been able to disentangle ourselves from theextremes of absolutism and nihilism and to take seriously the possibilitiesinherent in a mindful, open-ended stance toward human experience. These twoextremes of absolutism and nihilism both lead us away from the lived world; inthe case of absolutism, we try to escape actual experience by invoking foundationsto supply our lives with a sense of justification and purpose; in the case ofnihilism, failing in that search, we deny the possibility of working with oureveryday experience in a way that is liberating and transformative.

# [11 ]()Laying Down a Path in Walking 

## Science and Experience in Circulation 

In the preface weannounced that the theme of this book would be the circulation betweencognitive science and human experience. In this final chapter we wish tosituate this circulation within a wider contemporary context. In particular wewish to consider some of the ethical dimensions of groundlessness in relationto the concern with nihilism that is typical of much post-Nietzschean thought.This is not the place to consider the many points that animate current NorthAmerican and European discussions; our concern, rather, is to indicate how wesee our project in relation to these discussions and to suggest furtherdirections for investigation. 

The back-and-forthcommunication between cognitive science and experience that we have exploredcan be envisioned as a circle. The circle begins with the experience of thecognitive scientist, a human being who can conceive of a mind operating withouta self. This becomes embodied in a scientific theory. Emboldened by the theory,one can discover, with a disciplined, mindful approach to experience, thatalthough there is constant struggle to maintain a self, there is no actual selfin experience. The natural scientific inquisitiveness of the mind then queries,But how can there seem to be a coherent self when there is none? For an answerone can turn to mechanisms such as emergence and societies of mind. Ideallythat could lead one to penetrate further into the causal relationships in one’sexperience, seeing the causes and effects of ego grasping and enabling one to beginto relax the struggle of ego grasping. As perceptions, relationships, and theactivity of mind expand into awareness, one might have insight into thecodependent lack of ultimate foundations either for one’s mind or for itsobjects, the world. The inquisitive scientist then asks, How can we imagine,embodied in a mechanism, that relation of codependence between mind and world?The mechanism that we have created (the embodied metaphor of groundlessness) isthat of enactive cognition, with its image of structural coupling through ahistory of natural drift. Ideally such an image can influence the scientificsociety and the larger society, loosening the hold of both objectivism andsubjectivism and encouraging further communication between science and experience,experience and science. 

The logic of thisback-and-forth circle exemplified the fundamental circularity in the mind ofthe reflective scientist. The fundamental axis of this circulation is theembodiment of experience and cognition. It should be recalled that embodimentin our sense, as for Merleau-Ponty, encompasses both the body as a lived,experiential structure and the body as the context or milieu of cognitivemechanisms. Thus in the communication we have portrayed in this book betweencognitive science and the tradition of mindfulness/awareness, we havesystematically juxtaposed the descriptions of experience taken frommindfulness/awareness practice with descriptions of cognitive architecturetaken from cognitive science. 

Like Merleau-Ponty, wehave emphasized that a proper appreciation of this twofold sense of embodimentprovides a middle way or entre-deux between the extremes of absolutism andnihilism. Both of these two extremes can be found in contemporary cognitivescience. The absolutist extreme is easy to find, for despite other differences,the varieties of cognitive realism share the conviction that cognition isgrounded in the representation of a pregiven world by a pregiven subject. Thenihilist extreme is less apparent, but we have seenhow it arises when cognitive science uncovers the nonunity of the self yetignores the possibility of a transformative approach to human experience. 

So far we have devotedless attention to this nihilist extreme, but it is in fact far more indicativeof our contemporary cultural situation. Thus in the humanities—in art,literature, and philosophy—the growing awareness of groundlessness has takenform not through a confrontation with objectivism but rather with nihilism,skepticism, and extreme relativism. Indeed, this concern with nihilism istypical of late-twentieth-century life. Its visible manifestations are theincreasing fragmentation of life, the revival of and continuing adherence to avariety of religious and political dogmatisms, and a pervasive yet intangiblefeeling of anxiety, which writers such as Milan Kundera in TheUnbearable Lightness of Being depict so vividly. It is for this reason(and because nihilism and objectivism are actually deeply connected) that weturn to consider in more detail the nihilistic extreme. We have reserved thisissue until now because it is both general and far reaching. Our discussionmust accordingly become more centrally concerned with the ethical dimension ofgroundlessness than it has been so far. In the final section of this chapter wewill be more explicit about this ethical dimension. Before doing so, however,we wish to examine in more detail the nihilist extreme. 

## Nihilismand the Need for Planetary Thinking 

Let us begin not byattempting to engage nihilism directly but rather by asking how nihilismarises. Where and at what point does the nihilist tendency first manifestitself? 

We have been led to facegroundlessness or the lack of stable foundations in both enactive cognitivescience and in the mindful, open-ended approach to experience. In both settingswe began naively but were forced to suspend our deep-seated conviction that theworld is grounded independently of embodied perceptual and cognitivecapacities. This deep-seated conviction is the motivation for objectivism—evenin its most refined philosophical forms. Nihilism, however, is in a sense basedon no analogous conviction, for it arises initially in reaction to the loss offaith in objectivism. Nihilism can, of course, be cultivated to a point whereit takes on a life of its own, but in its first moment its form is one of response. Thus we can already see that nihilism is in factdeeply linked to objectivism, for nihilism is an extreme response to thecollapse of what had seemed to provide a sure and absolute reference point. 

We have already providedan example of this link between objectivism and nihilism when we examined thediscovery within cognitive science of selfless minds. This deep and profounddiscovery requires the cognitive scientist to acknowledge that consciousnessand self-identity do not provide the ground or foundation for cognitiveprocesses; yet she feels that we do believe, and must continue to believe, inan efficacious self. The usual response of the cognitive scientist is to ignorethe experiential aspect when she does science and ignore the scientificdiscovery when she leads her life. As a result, the nonexistence of a self thatwould answer to our objectivist representations is typically confused with thenonexistence of the relative (practical) self altogether. Indeed, without theresources provided by a progressive approach to experience, there is littlechoice but to respond to the collapse of an objective self (objectivism) byasserting the objective nonexistence of the self (nihilism). 

This response indicatesthat objectivism and nihilism, despite their apparent differences, are deeplyconnected—indeed the actual source of nihilism is objectivism. We have alreadydiscussed how the basis of objectivism is to be found in our habitual tendencyto grasp after regularities that are stable but ungrounded. In fact, nihilismtoo arises from this grasping mind. Thus faced with the discovery ofgroundlessness, we nonetheless continue to grasp after a ground because we havenot relinquished the deep-seated reflex to grasp that lies at the root ofobjectivism. This reflex is so strong that the absence ofa solid ground is immediately reified into the objectivist abyss. This act ofreification performed by the grasping mind is the root of nihilism. The mode ofrepudiation or denial that is characteristic of nihilism is actually a verysubtle and refined form of objectivism: the mere absence of an objective groundis reified into an objective groundlessness that might continue to serve as anultimate reference point. Thus although we have been speaking of objectivismand nihilism as opposed extremes with differing consequences, they ultimatelyshare a common basis in the grasping mind. 

An appreciation of thecommon source of objectivism and nihilism lies at the heart of the philosophyand practice of the middle way in Buddhism. For this reason, we are simplymisinformed when we assume that concern with nihilism is a modern phenomenon ofGreco-European origin. To appreciate the resources offered by these othertraditions, however, we must not lose sight of the specificity of our presentsituation. Whereas in Buddhism, as anywhere else, there is always the danger ofindividuals experiencing nihilism (losing heart, as it is called in Buddhism)or of commentators straying into nihilistic errors of interpretation, nihilismhas never become full blown or embodied in societal institutions. 

Today nihilism is atangible issue not only for our Western culture but for the planet as a whole.And yet as we have seen throughout this book, the groundlessness of the middleway in Mahayana Buddhism offers considerable resources for human experience inour present scientific culture. The mere recognition of this fact shouldindicate that the imaginative geography of “West” and “East” is no longerappropriate for the tasks we face today. Although we can begin from thepremises and concerns of our own tradition, we need no longer proceed inignorance of other traditions, especially of those that continually strived todistinguish rigorously between the groundlessness of nihilism and thegroundlessness of the middle way. 

Unlike Richard Rorty,then, we are not inspired in our attempt to face the issue of groundlessnessand nihilism by the ideal of simply “continuing the conversation of the West.”[1](#1_23) Instead, our project throughoutthis book owes far more to Martin Heidegger’s invocation of “planetarythinking.” As Heidegger wrote in The Question of Being,

We are obliged not to give up the effort to practice planetary thinkingalong a stretch of the road, be it ever so short. Here too no prophetic talentsand demeanor are needed to realize that there are in store for planetarybuilding encounters for which the participants are by no means equal today.This is equally true of the European and of the East Asiatic languages and,above all, for the area of a possible conversation between them. Neither one ofthe two is able by itself to open up this area and to establish it.[2](#2_23) 

Our guiding metaphor isthat a path exists only in walking, and our conviction has been that as a firststep we must face the issue of groundlessness in our scientific culture andlearn to embody that groundlessness in the openness of sunyata. One of thecentral figures of twentieth-century Japanese philosophy, Nishitani Keiji, hasin fact made precisely this claim.[3](#3_22)Nishitani is exemplary for us because he was not only raised and personallyimmersed in the Zen tradition of mindfulness/awareness but was also one ofHeidegger’s students and so is thoroughly familiar with European thought ingeneral and Heidegger’s invocation of planetary thinking in particular.Nishitani’s endeavor to develop a truly planetary form of philosophical yetembodied, progressive reflection is impressive. Let us pause to examine a fewof the essential points of his thinking. 

## NishitaniKeiji 

In our discussion of theCartesian anxiety, we saw that there is an oscillation between objectivism andsubjectivism that is linked to the concept of representation. Thusrepresentation can be construed either as the “projection” (subjectivism) or“recovery” (objectivism) of the world. (Usually, of course, both aspects ofrepresentation are incorporated in accounts of perception and cognition.) 

For Nishitani, thisoscillation between subjectivism and objectivism arises for any philosophicalstance that is based on what he calls “the field of consciousness.” With thisphrase Nishitani refers to the philosophical construal of the world as anobjective or pregiven realm and of the self as a pregiven knowing subject thatsomehow achieves contact with this pregiven world. Since consciousness is hereunderstood as subjectivity, the problem arises of how to link consciousnesswith the supposedly objective realm in which it is situated. As we have alreadydiscussed, however, the subject cannot step outside of its representations to beholdthe pregiven world as it really is in itself. Therefore given this basicallyCartesian stance, the objective becomes what is represented as such by thesubject. In Nishitani’s words, “The mode of being which is said to have riditself of its relationship to the subjective has simply been constitutedthrough a covert inclusion of a relationship to the subjective, and so cannot,after all, escape the charge of constituting a mode of being defined throughits appearance to us.”[4](#4_23)

When the notion ofobjectivity becomes problematic in this way, so too does the notion ofsubjectivity. If everything is ultimately specified through its appearance tous, then so is the knowing subject. Since the subject can represent itself toitself, it becomes an object for representation but is different from all otherobjects. Thus in the end the self becomes both an objectified subject and asubjectified object. This predicament discloses the shiftiness, the instabilityof the entire subjective/objective polarity. 

Nishitani’s next move,however, displays the deep influence of the Buddhist philosophical traditionand mindfulness/awareness practice on his thinking. He argues that to realizethe fundamental instability or groundlessness of the subjective/objectivedualism is in a sense to slip out of the “field of consciousness.” We do not“overcome” or “step out” of this dualism as if we knew in advance where we aregoing, but we do see the arbitrariness and futility of going back and forthbetween the poles of a fundamentally groundless opposition. Instead our concernshifts to the very disclosure of this groundlessness. Nishitani then followsthe pragmatic intention of mindfulness/awareness by emphasizing the existentialrole that this disclosure plays. The realization that we do not stand on solidground, that things incessantly arise and pass away without our being able topin them down to a stable objective or subjective ground, affects our very lifeand being. Within this existential context, we can be said to realize groundlessness not only in the sense of understanding but also in the sense of actualization:human life or existence turns into a question, doubt, or uncertainty. 

In Zen Buddhism, theJapanese adaptation of mindfulness/awareness in which Nishitani was raised,this uncertainty is called the “Great Doubt.” This doubt is not about anyparticular matter but is rather the basic uncertainty that arises from thedisclosure of groundlessness. Unlike the hyperbolic and hypothetical doubt ofDescartes, which is merely entertained by the subject on the field ofconsciousness, the Great Doubt points to the impermanence of existence itselfand so marks an existential transformation within human experience. This transformationconsists of a conversion away from the subjective/objective standpoint to whatis called in the English translation of Nishitani’s work the“field of nihility.” Nihility is a term used to referto groundlessness in relation to the subjective/objective polarity; it is arelative, negative notion of groundlessness that Nishitani wishes todistinguish from the groundlessness of the middle way. 

Nishitani distinguishesbetween these two kinds of groundlessness because his fundamental point is thatEuropean thought in its largely successful critique of objectivism has becometrapped in nihilism. Here Nishitani’s assessment of our situation actuallyfollows Nietzsche’s. As we mentioned in chapter 6, nihilism arises forNietzsche when we realize that our most cherished beliefs are untenable and yetwe are incapable of living without them. Nietzsche devoted considerableattention to the manifestation of nihilism in our discovery that we do notstand on solid ground, that what we take to be an absolute reference point isreally an interpretation foisted on an ever-shifting impersonal process. Hisfamous aphorism announcing “the death of God” is a dramatic statement of thiscollapse of fixed reference points. Nietzsche also understood nihilism to berooted in our craving for a ground, in our continual search for some ultimatereference point, even when we realize that none can be found: “What doesnihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim islacking; ‘why’ finds no answer.”[5](#5_23) The philosophical challenge thatNietzsche faced, which has come to characterize the task of postmodern thought,is to lay down a path of thinking and practice that gives up foundationswithout transforming itself into a search for new foundations.[6](#6_22)Nietzsche’s attempt is well known: he tried to undercut nihilism by affirminggroundlessness through his notions of eternal return and the will to power. 

Nishitani deeply admiresNietzsche’s attempt but claims that it actually perpetuates the nihilisticpredicament by not letting go of the grasping mind that lies at the souce ofboth objectivism and nihilism. Nishitani’s argument is that nihilism cannot be overcomeby assimilating groundlessness to a notion of the will—nomatter how decentered and impersonal. Nishitani’s diagnosis is even moreradical than Nietzsche’s, for he claims that the real problem with Westernnihilism is that it is halfhearted: it does not consistently follow through itsown inner logic and motivation and so stops short of transforming its partialrealization of groundlessness into the philosophical and experientialpossibilities of sunyata. The reason why Western nihilism stops short is thatWestern thought in general has no tradition that works with cognition and livedexperience in a direct and pragmatic way. (The one possible exception ispsychoanalysis, but in most of its current manifestations it has been unable toconfront the basic contradictions in our experience of the self or to offer atransformative reembodiment.) Indeed, our scientific culture has only justbegun to consider the possibility of pragmatic and progressive approaches toexperience that would enable us to learn to transform our deep-seated andemotional grasping after a ground. Without such a pragmatic approach to thetransformation of experience in everyday life—especially within our developingscientific culture—human existence will remain confined to the undecidablechoice between objectivism and nihilism. 

We should note thatNishitani’s point when he claims that Western nihilism stops short of thegroundlessness of the middle way is not that we should adopt Buddhism in thesense of a particular tradition with various cultural trappings. It is, rather,that we must achieve an understanding of groundlessness as a middle way byworking from our own cultural premises. These premises are largely determinedby science, for we live in a scientific culture. We have therefore chosen tofollow Nishitani’s lead by building a bridge between cognitive science andmindfulness/awareness as a specific practice that embodies an open-endedapproach to experience. Furthermore, since we cannot embody groundlessness in ascientific culture without reconceptualizing science itself as beyond the needof foundations, we have followed through the inner logic of research incognitive science to develop the enactive approach. This approach should serveto demonstrate that a commitment to science need not include as a premise acommitment to objectivism or to subjectivism. 

Objectivist science, byits very ideals as well as its historical context in our society, hasmaintained a role of ethical neutrality. This neutrality has been increasinglychallenged in the social discourse of our time. Theneed for planetary thinking behooves us to consider groundlessness, whetherevoked by cognitive science or experience, in its full light in the total humancontext. Is it not the self that has been considered the bearer of moral andethical potency? If we challenge the idea of such a self, what have we loosedon the world? Such a concern, we feel, is the result of the failure in Westerndiscourse to analyze the self and its product, self-interest, with experientialacumen. In contrast, the ethical dimension of ego and egolessness are at thevery heart of the Buddhist tradition. We turn now to take up, as our finalconsideration, the issue of what the mindfulness/awareness tradition might haveto offer social science for a vision of human action at its best. 

## Ethics and Human Transformation 

### TheView from Social Science 

A parable called “TheTragedy of the Commons” haunts social research on ethical concerns.[7](#7_21) The parable describes a situationin which a number of herdsmen graze their herds on a common pasturage. Eachherdsman knows that it is in his self-interest to increase the size of his herdbecause, whereas each additional animal brings profit to him, the cost ofgrazing the animal and the damage done to the pasturage is shared by all theherdsmen. As a result, each of the herdsmen rationally increases his herd sizeuntil the commons is destroyed and, with it, all of the herds that grazed onit. The concern of the social scientist is how one can get a group ofrationally self-interested herdsmen to cooperate in maintaining the vanishingcommons. 

This disarminglydisingenuous metaphor for our world situation embodies a long tradition ofmodern thought about the self and its relation to others, which may be calledthe economic view of the mind. The goal of the self is assumed to beprofit—getting the most at least cost. The unconstrained economic man,[8](#8_21) such as Hobbes’s despot,[9](#9_23) continues his acquisitions untilthere is nothing left for anyone else. Therefore, constraints are needed: overtsocial force, internalized socialization, subtle psychological mechanisms. Ageneral theory called social exchange theory, widely used in social psychology,decision theory, sociology, economics, and political science, views all ofhuman activity, individually and in groups, in terms of input and outputcalculations, paying and receiving. We believe that this implicit vision ofmotivation underlies not only social science but many contemporary people’sviews of their own action. Even altruism is defined in terms of an individualobtaining (psychological) utility from benefiting another. 

Is such a viewexperientially validated? Practitioners in the mindfulness/awareness tradition,as they begin to become mindful, are often amazed to discover the extent oftheir egotism, the increasingly subtle levels at which they find themselvesoperating with just such a business-deal mentality. They are also led toquestion whether such a stance toward the world makes sense. 

We believe that the viewof the self as an economic man, which is the view the social sciences hold, isquite consonant with the unexamined view of our own motivation that we hold asordinary, nonmindful people. Let us state that view clearly. The self is seenas a territory with boundaries. The goal of the self is to bring inside theboundaries all of the good things while paying out as few goods as possible andconversely to remove to the outside of the boundaries all of the bad thingswhile letting in as little bad as possible. Since goods are scarce, eachautonomous self is in competition with other selves to get them. Sincecooperation between individuals and whole societies may be needed to get moregoods, uneasy and unstable alliances are formed between autonomous selves. Someselves (altruists) and many selves in some roles (parents, teachers) may get(immaterial) goods by helping other selves, but they will become disappointed(even disillusioned) if those other selves do not reciprocate by being properlyhelped. 

What does themindfulness/awareness tradition or enactive cognitive science have tocontribute to this portrait of self-interest?[10](#10_22) The mindful, open-ended approachto experience reveals that moment by moment this so-called self occurs only inrelation to the other. If I want praise, love, fame, or power, there has to beanother (even if only a mental one) to praise, love, know about, or submit tome. If I want to obtain things, they have to be things that I don’t alreadyhave. Even with respect to the desire for pleasure,the pleasure is something to which I am in a relation. Because self is alwayscodependent with other (even at the gross level we are now discussing), theforce of self-interest is always other-directed in the very same respect withwhich it is self-directed. 

What, then, are peopledoing who appear so self-interested as opposed to other-interested?Mindfulness/awareness meditators suggest that those people are struggling, in aconfused way, to maintain the sense of a separate self by engaging inself-referential relationships with the other. Whether I gain or lose, therecan be a sense of I; if there is nothing to be gained or lost, I am groundless.If Hobbes’s despot were actually to succeed in obtaining everything in theuniverse, he would have to find some other preoccupation quickly, or he wouldbe in a woeful state: he would be unable to maintain his sense of himself. Ofcourse, as we have seen with nihilism, one can always turn that groundlessnessinto a ground; then one can maintain oneself in relation to it by feelingdespair. 

We believe that thisinsight is important to the social sciences if they are to explain the egoisticbehavior of individuals and groups. Even more important, however, is what themindful, open-ended approach to experience has to contribute to thetransformation of that egotism. 

### Compassion:Worlds without Ground 

If planetary thinkingrequires that we embody the realization of groundlessness in a scientificculture, planetary building requires the embodiment of concern for the otherwith whom we enact a world. The tradition of mindfulness/awareness offers apath by which this may actually be brought about. 

Themindfulness/awareness student first begins to see in a precise fashion what themind is doing, its restless, perpetual grasping, moment to moment. This enablesthe student to cut some of the automaticity of his habitual patterns, whichleads to further mindfulness, and he begins to realize that there is no self inany of his actual experience. This can be disturbing and offers the temptationto swing to the other extreme, producing moments of loss of heart. Thephilosophical flight into nihilism that we saw earlier in this chapter mirrorsa psychological process: the reflex to grasp is so strong and deep seated thatwe reify the absence of a solid foundation into a solid absence or abyss. 

As the student goes on,however, and his mind relaxes further into awareness, a sense of warmth andinclusiveness dawns. The street fighter mentality of watchful self-interest canbe let go somewhat to be replaced by interest in others. We are alreadyother-directed even at our most negative, and we already feel warmth towardsome people, such as family and friends. The conscious realization of the senseof relatedness and the development of a more impartial sense of warmth areencouraged in the mindfulness/awareness tradition by various contemplativepractices such as the generation of loving-kindness. It is said that the fullrealization of groundlessness (sunyata) cannot occur if there is no warmth. 

For this reason, in theMahayana tradition, which we have so far presented as being centrally concernedwith groundlessness as sunyata, there is an equally central and complementaryconcern with groundlessness as compassion.[11](#11_20) In fact, most of the traditionalMahayana presentations do not begin with groundlessness but rather with thecultivation of compassion for all sentient beings. Nagarjuna, for example,states in one of his works that the Mahayana teaching has “an essence ofemptiness and compassion.”[12](#12_18) This statement is sometimesparaphrased by saying that emptiness (sunyata) is full of compassion (karuna).[13](#13_19) 

Thus sunyata, the lossof a fixed reference point or ground in either self, other, or a relationshipbetween them, is said to be inseparable from compassion like the two sides of acoin or the two wings of a bird. Our natural impulse, in this view, is one ofcompassion, but it has been obscured by habits of ego-clinging like the sunobscured by a passing cloud. 

This is by no means the end of the path, however. For some traditions,there is a further step to be made in understanding beyond the sunyata ofcodependent origination—that is, the sunyata of naturalness. Up to now, we havebeen talking about the contents of realization in primarily negative terms: no-self, egolessness, no world, nonduality, emptiness,groundlessness. In actual fact, the majority of theworld’s Buddhists do not speak of their deepest concerns in negative terms;these negatives are preliminaries—necessary to remove habitual patterns ofgrasping, unsurpassably important and precious, but nonethelesspreliminaries—that are pointing toward the realization of a positivelyconceived state. The Western world—for example, Christianity—although pleasedto engage in dialogue with the negating aspects of Buddhism (perhaps as a wayof speaking to the nihilism in our own tradition), steadfastly (at times evenself-consciously) tends to ignore the Buddhist positive.[14](#14_19) 

To be sure, the Buddhistpositive is threatening. It is no ground whatsoever; it cannot be grasped asground, reference point, or nest for a sense of ego. It does not exist—nor doesit not exist.[15](#15_18) It cannot be an object of mind orof the conceptualizing process; it cannot be seen, heard, or thought—thus themany traditional images for it: the sight of a blind man, a flower blooming inthe sky. When the conceptual mind tries to grasp it, it finds nothing, and soit experiences it as emptiness. It can be known (and can only be known)directly. It is called Buddha nature, no mind, primordial mind, absolutebodhicitta, wisdom mind, warrior’s mind, all goodness, great perfection, that whichcannot be fabricated by mind, naturalness. It is not a hair’s breadth differentfrom the ordinary world; it is that very same ordinary, conditional,impermanent, painful, groundless world experienced (known) as theunconditional, supreme state. And the natural manifestation, the embodiment, ofthis state is compassion—unconditional, fearless, ruthless, spontaneouscompassion. “When the reasoning mind no longer clings and grasps, … one awakensinto the wisdom with which one was born, and compassionate energy ariseswithout pretense.”[16](#16_19) 

What do we mean byunconditional compassion? We need to backtrack and consider the development ofcompassion from the more mundane point of view of the student. The possibilityfor compassionate concern for others, which is present in all humans, isusually mixed with the sense of ego and so becomes confused with the need tosatisfy one’s own cravings for recognition and self-evaluation. The spontaneouscompassion that arises when one is not caught in the habitual patterns—when oneis not performing volitional actions out of karmic cause and effect—is not donewith a sense of need for feedback from its recipient. It is the anxiety aboutfeedback—the response of the other—that causes us tension and inhibition in ouraction. When action is done without the business-deal mentality, there can berelaxation. This is called supreme (or transcendental) generosity.[17](#17_17) 

If this seems abstract,the reader might try a brief exercise. We usually read books like this withsome heavy-handed sense of purpose. Imagine for a moment that you are readingthis solely in order to benefit others. Does that change the feeling tone ofthe task? 

When discussing wisdomfrom the point of view of compassion, the Sanskrit term often used is bodhicitta, which has been variously translated as“enlightened mind,” “the heart of the enlightened state of mind,” or simply“awakened heart.” Bodhicitta is said to have two aspects, one absolute and onerelative. Absolute bodhicitta is the term applied to whatever state isconsidered ultimate or fundamental in a given Buddhist tradition—the experienceof the groundlessness of sunyata or the (positively defined) sudden glimpse ofthe natural, awake state itself.[18](#18_17)Relative bodhicitta is that fundamental warmth toward the phenomenal world thatpractitioners report arises from absolute experience and that manifests itselfas concern for the welfare of others beyond merely naive compassion. As opposedto the order in which we have previously described these experiences, it issaid that the development of a sense of unproblematical warmth toward the worldleads to the experience of the flash of absolute bodhicitta. 

Buddhist practitioners obviously do not realize any of these things(even mindfulness) all at once. They report that they catch glimpses thatencourage them to make further efforts. One of the most important stepsconsists in developing compassion toward one’s own grasping fixation onego-self. The idea behind this attitude is that confronting one’s own graspingtendencies is a friendly act toward oneself. As this friendliness develops,one’s awareness and concern for those around one enlarges as well. It is atthis point that one can begin to envision a more open-ended and nonegocentriccompassion. 

Another characteristicof the spontaneous compassion that does not arise out of the volitional action ofhabitual patterns is that it follows no rules. It is not derived from anaxiomatic ethical system nor even from pragmatic moral injunctions. It iscompletely responsive to the needs of the particular situation. Nagarjunaconveys this attitude of responsiveness: 

Just as the grammarian makes one study grammar, 

A Buddha teaches according to the tolerance of his students; 

Some he urges to refrain from sins, others to do good, 

Some to rely on dualism, others on non-dualism; 

And to some he teaches the profound, 

The terrifying, the practice of enlightenment, 

Whose essence is emptiness that is compassion.[19](#19_17) 

Unrealizedpractitioners, of course, cannot dispense with rules and moral injunctions.There are many ethical rules in Buddhism whose aim is to put the body and mindinto a form that imitates as nearly as possible how genuine compassion mightbecome manifest in that situation (just as the meditative sitting posture issaid to be an imitation of enlightenment). 

With respect to itssituational specificity and its responsiveness, this view of nonegocentriccompassion might seem similar to what has been discussed in certain recentpsychoanalytic writings as “ethical know-how.”[20](#20_17) In the case of compassionateconcern as generated in the context of mindfulness/awareness, this know-howcould be said to be based in responsiveness to oneself and others as sentientbeings without ego-selves who suffer because they grasp after ego-selves. Andthis attitude of responsiveness is in turn rooted in an ongoing concern: Howcan groundlessness be revealed ethically as nonegocentric compassion? 

Compassionate action isalso called skillful means (upaya) in Buddhism.Skillful means are inseparable from wisdom. It is interesting to consider therelationship of skillful means to ordinary skills such as learning to drive acar or learning to play the violin. Is ethical action (compassionate action) inBuddhism to be considered a skill—perhaps analogous to the Heidegger/Dreyfusaccount of ethical action as a non-rule-based, developed skill?[21](#21_16) As we discussed at some lengthwith respect to meditation practice, in some ways skillful means in Buddhismcould be seen as similar to our notion of a skill: the student practices(“plants good seeds”)—that is, avoids harmful actions, performs beneficialones, meditates. Unlike an ordinary skill, however, in skillful means theultimate effect of these practices is to remove all egocentric habits so thatthe practitioner can realize the wisdom state, and compassionate action canarise directly and spontaneously out of wisdom. It is as if one were born alreadyknowing how to play the violin and had to practice with great exertion only toremove the habits that prevented one from displaying that virtuosity. 

It should by now be obvious that the ethics of compassion has nothingto do with satisfying some pleasure principle. Fom the standpoint ofmindfulness/awareness, it is fundamentally impossible to satisfy desires thatare born within the grasping mind. A sense of unconditional well-being arisesonly through letting go of the grasping mind. There is, however, no reason forascetism. Material and social goods are to be employed however the situationwarrants. (The middle way between the extremes of ascetism and indulgence isactually the historically earliest sense in which the term middleway was employed in Buddhism.) 

The results of the pathof mindful, open-ended learning are profoundly transformative. Instead of beingembodied (more accurately, reembodied moment after moment) out of struggle,habit, and sense of self, the goal is to become embodied out of compassion forthe world.[22](#22_17) The Tibetan tradition even talksabout the five aggregates being transformed into the five wisdoms. Notice thatthis sense of transformation does not mean going away from the world—gettingout of the five aggregates. The aggregates may be the constituents on which theinaccurate sense of self and world are based, but (more properly and) they are also the basis of wisdom. The means oftransforming the aggregates into wisdom is knowledge, realizing the aggregatesaccurately—empty of any egoistic ground whatsoever yet filled withunconditional goodness (Buddha nature, etc.), intrinsically just as they are inthemselves. 

How can such an attitudeof all encompassing, decentered, responsive, compassionate concern be fosteredand embodied in our culture? It obviously cannot be created merely throughnorms and rationalistic injunctions. It must be developed and embodied througha discipline that facilitates letting go of ego-centered habits and enablescompassion to become spontaneous and self-sustaining. The point is not thatthere is no need for normative rules in the relative world—clearly such rulesare a necessity in any society. It is that unless such rules are informed by thewisdom that enables them to be dissolved in the demands of responsivity to theparticularity and immediacy of lived situations, the rules will become sterile,scholastic hindrances to compassionate action rather than conduits for itsmanifestation. 

Perhaps less obvious buteven more strongly enjoined by the mindfulness/awareness tradition is thatmeditations and practices undertaken simply as self-improvement schemes willfoster only egohood. Because of the strength of egocentric habitualconditioning, there is a constant tendency, as practitioners in allcontemplative traditions are aware, to try to grasp, possess, and become proudof the slightest insight, glimpse of openness, or understanding. Unless suchtendencies become part of the path of letting go that leads to compassion, theninsights can actually do more harm than good. Buddhist teachers have oftenwritten that it is far better to remain as an ordinary person and believe inultimate foundations than to cling to some remembered experience of groundlessnesswithout manifesting compassion. 

Finally, talk alone willcertainly not suffice to engender spontaneous nonegocentric concern. Even morethan experiences of insight, words and concepts can be easily grasped at, takenas ground, and woven into a cloak of egohood. Teachers in all contemplativetraditions warn against fixated views and concepts taken as reality. Indeed,our promulgations of the concept of enactive cognitive science give us somepause. We would surely not want to trade the relative humility of objectivismfor the hubris of thinking that we construct our world. Better by far astraightforward cognitivist than a bloated and solipsistic enactivist. 

We simply cannotoverlook the need for some form of sustained, disciplined practice. This is notsomething that one can make up for oneself—any more than one can make up thehistory of Western science for oneself. Nothing will take its place; one cannotjust do one form of science rather than another andthink that one is gaining wisdom or becoming ethical. Individuals mustpersonally discover and admit their own sense of ego in order to go beyond it.Although this happens at the individual level, it has implications for scienceand for society. 

### InConclusion 

Let us restate why wethink ethics in the mindfulness/awareness tradition, and indeed, themindfulness/awareness tradition itself, are so important to the modern world.There is a profound discovery of groundlessness in our culture—in science, inthe humanities, in society, and in the uncertainties of people’s daily lives.This is generally seen as something negative—by everyone from the prophets ofour time to ordinary people struggling to find meaning in their lives. Takinggroundlessness as negative, as a loss, leads to a sense of alienation, despair,loss of heart, and nihilism. The cure that is generally espoused in our cultureis to find a new grounding (or return to older grounds). Themindfulness/awareness tradition points the way to a radically differentresolution. In Buddhism, we have a case study showing that when groundlessnessis embraced and followed through to its ultimate conclusions, the outcome is anunconditional sense of intrinsic goodness that manifests itself in the world asspontaneous compassion. We feel, therefore, that the solution for the sense ofnihilistic alienation in our culture is not to try to find a new ground; it isto find a disciplined and genuine means to pursue groundlessness, to go furtherinto groundlessness. Because of the preeminent place science occupies in ourculture, science must be involved in this pursuit. 

Althoughlate-twentieth-century science repeatedly undermines our conviction in anultimate ground, we nonetheless continue to seek one. We have laid down a pathin both cognitive science and human experience that would lead us away fromthis dilemma. We repeat that this is not a merely philosophical dilemma; it isalso ethical, religious, and political. Grasping can be expressed not onlyindividually as fixation on ego-self but also collectively as fixation onracial or tribal self-identity, as well as grasping for a ground as theterritory that separates one group of people from another or that one groupwould appropriate as its own. The idolatry of supposing not only that there isa ground but that one can appropriate it as one’s own acknowledges the otheronly in a purely negative, exclusionary way. The realization of groundlessnessas nonegocentric responsiveness, however, requires that we acknowledge theother with whom we dependently cooriginate. If our task in the years ahead, aswe believe, is to build and dwell in a planetary world, then we must learn touproot and release the grasping tendency, especially in its collectivemanifestations. 

When we widen ourhorizon to include transformative approaches to experience, especially thoseconcerned not with escape from the world or the discovery of some hidden, trueself but with releasing the everyday world from the clutches of the graspingmind and its desire for an absolute ground, we gain a sense of perspective onthe world that might be brought forth by learning to embody groundlessness ascompassion in a scientific culture. Since we have been most affected by theBuddhist tradition and its approach to experience through mindfulness/awareness,we were naturally led to rely on this tradition in relation to the task ofscientific and planetary building. Science is already deeply embedded in ourculture. Buddhism from all the world’s cultures is now taking root andbeginning to develop in the West. When these two planetary forces, science andBuddhism, come genuinely together, what might not happen? At the very least,the journey of Buddhism to the West provides some of the resources we need topursue consistently our own cultural and scientific premises to the point wherewe no longer need and desire foundations and so can take up the further tasksof building and dwelling in worlds without ground.

[22.](#22_16) This is the image of the bodhisattva,a being who vows to continue to be reborn endlessly for the sake of others rather than out of his own karma (andrather than departing to nirvana). Practitioners in the Mahayana and Vajrayanatraditions take this idea seriously and themselves take bodhisattva ordinationsand vows. Historians who treat the development of the bodhisattva ideal inMahayana Buddhism as the degeneration of Buddhism into polytheism might do wellto look at the way this ideal is treated in actual Buddhist communities.

# Appendix A: Meditation Terminology 

Shamatha (Sanscrit) shine (Tibetan) Meditation forstilling and calming the mind. Traditionally, a concentration technique. It israrely practiced in its most pure, radical form. 

Vipassana (Pali) The meditation technique practiced today in the Theravadatradition of Buddhism. Its purpose is both to calm the mind and arouse insight.The general technique is for the mind to remain mindfully with its object,whatever that object may be. There are many specific techniques. 

Vispashyana (Sanscrit) Lhagthong (Tibetan) Insight. Theterm is used in at least two major senses: 

1.   Specific techniques used withinmeditation for examining the calmed mind to obtain insight into its nature. Forexample, one might be directed to investigate the point of the arising,dwelling, and vanishing of one’s thoughts. 

2.  The panoramic awareness inmeditation or daily life that enables the practitioner to see with a sense ofmature wisdom whatever is occurring. 

Shamatha/vispashyana (Sanscrit) A variety of techniques in which the functions of calmingthe mind and obtaining insight are combined. 

Shikantaza (Japanese) Just sitting. No technique.Somewhat equivalent to the second sense of vispashyana. 

The reader should notethat various modern schools of Buddhism refer to similar techniques bydifferent terms and different techniques by the same term, so one cannot tellfrom terminology alone what meditation is being practiced. 

A bibliography formeditation techniques is provided in appendix C. To practice meditation, oneshould obtain the guidance of a qualified teacher.
